No, see if he committed the murder in Boulder City, Nevada, *then* its his own dam fault but you certainly cant blame Hoover that dudes been dead for years.

Around here they were Caramel Delights when I was a kid but then at some point became Samoas. I had assumed they just changed the name, like with peanut butter patties. Then there was some controversy over it at some point because people were saying Samoas is politically incorrect because of the island nation of the same name.
You are a good person
When I go to my local grocery store and they are there I just keep telling myself I won't buy anything. They usually have the cutest little girl ask if you want girl scout cookies. Then I see her mom and I end up buying 4 boxes.
Mine is only 4 inches. Across the head. Next?
Well I had a 14" penis tattood on mine, so there!
You are a good person.

Its a totally different genre of music my friend
I did a similar survey last year.  The results were all over the road.
When someone raps they don't sing. Hiphop is just a more pop version of rap for the masses. Because it has some singing on beats. 

RnB is singing, it is rhythm and blues. 

When you listened to "I believe I can fly" there's just singing. No rap or hiphop.
Hes an RnBist bro, dont u listen?

A quarter pounder may have a burger that weighs a fifth of a pound.

What do you even mean by this? A quarter pounder is a quarter of a pound. If it was a fifth of a pound it wouldnt be a quarter pounder.

Which is my point
[deleted]
To me the one liner does not have its original meaning anymore. Just like a lot of phrases. Like a quarter punder may have a burger that weighs one fifth of a pound. I classify as one liner anything that has a quick setup, quick delivery style. See a lot of Milton Jones or Gary Delaneys one liners, for example. 
These kinds of rigid classifications make sense only in the realm of creations in verse, in my opinion.
I mean, its semantics but to me a one liner is one line. 

This is a setup and a punchline in two sentences.
to me it does not matter that much if a one liner is indeed a pure immaculate one line. it needs to be funny, though. this is just a bad pun.
This is two sentences if you use proper grammar

Yeah, why did you put a period at the end of the sentence!!!
Well I've now seen this post a couple more times than I figured I would but now I know not to reread it or look at it because it is pointless
No theres actually a period at the end of the sentence so youre wrong
The joke is that it's not a joke, kind of like a shaggy dog story in one line.
I expected it to be because it's on a sub for jokes. So since it's not actually a joke, then does it truly belong on this sub?
Depends when you plan on seeing this again.
You were expecting it to be a joke, but it's not.
Okay...?
But if it is something worth looking out for, is it really pointless?
There's not information for anyone to get it.
You only know that from reading the sentence and now you have to look out for it.

Look out for something *pointless*.
Nah it wasn't pointless. It informed me on what level of import the sentence was to me. I now have that information.
I don't get it.

You cant seem to get your head out of your ass. Your sense of humor is like plastic nacho cheese. You think you can just say trump dumb and elicit a laugh, but youre actively being ratioed. Youre such a product of the system that you think you cant possibly not be funny, that people cant possibly *not* enjoy what youre saying because Trump jokes were a golden ticket for 4 years straight among most of your social circle. Well my friend, you stumbled upon a comedy subreddit and here people typically give a shit about whats funny and whats not, not which political religion you choose to practice.
Yet your anger is on the same level as the average Trump cultist.  Interesting... are you sure you didn't vote for Trump, because I can feel it through your use of rage.
Your joke isnt funny dumbass. This isnt political, your joke sucks ass.

I absolutely guarantee and would bet money thay if he died today we'd see people wailing in the streets like North Korea after Kim Jong Il died. His followers see him as a savior and really do worship him like a diety.
Who bullied a disabled man on television? Who bragged about sexually assaulting women on television? Who incited a seditionist riot on our nations capital? Who defrauded thousands of people who attended his university? Who cheated on his wife and paid off his mistress because he didnt want the bad press? Who REFUSED TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO WEAR A GODDAMN MASK? Who irresponsibly suggested that drinking bleach would kill coronavirus on television, causing hundreds of people to try it? *WHO CALLED SOLDIERS LOSERS???*

Yeah. That guy. There are definitely useful idiots in this scenario.
Likely. And theyll spend all their time insisting that hell be reinstated to life in time for the next election.
 joke of the year
"If"?? Shouldn't the oneliner begin with "When"?? Or, do you believe he might be immortal?
If Trump died, would all of the useful idiots stop with their irrational hatred of the president who got the lowest unemployment numbers for all races in recorded history?  Or stopped nations from taking advantage of us financially?  Or fast tracked three vaccines to FDA approval?  Or brought manufacturing jobs back to America?  Or got us into zero wars?  All this while being attacked by the leftist media and the Democrat party (but I repeat myself) for the entire term of his presidency?   No, you voted for the demented pedophile who, in his first year in office, caused the death of thirteen Americans and wounding of hundreds in what has to be the most idiotic exit from a war in world history.  Who shut down a pipeline and then asked OPEC to increase oil production?  Who literally hired the Taliban to provide protection for Americans in Afghanistan?  Who mentioned not wanting his kids to grow up in a racial jungle?  Who took 10% of the millions in kickbacks that went to his son, Hunter?  

But Trump supporters are cultists?   I guess better a cultist than a fucking moron.

No worries! OP didnt recite the joke correctly so I get why you were confused 
Reddit auto-bans certain words, blunting OP's edge.
Who's sucide
The joke, the spelling is not perfect but perfectly conveys the distress while writing a suicide joke.
No it doesnt, OP wrote the joke incorrectly its supposed to be the Dutch
You stole that from a smosh try not to laugh.
Except they only hate one person of that culture, a Dutch Makes no sense.
Ah, I get it. It was much simpler than I thought.

It reminded me of a a quote from the book _A Xenophobes Guide to the Dutch_ which states, Tolerance is not simply a virtue, its a national duty and thats why it left me puzzled. I hope you understand.
I too would be de-LIGHT-ed with such an en - LIGHT- ning job
The joke or the spelling?
1) its a joke from the movie, 2) the joke is that the person is a hypocrite because they say they hate people that dont accept other cultures and then outright say they hate a specific culture.
I know a guy who is currently a Director of engineering at a Forture 500 company whose  job was weeding and first promotion was to a Grave Digger.

Its funny 
I'd be suicidal if my grammar were that bad as well.
or, a slightly more serious version: hey cutie, is your name suicide? 'cause I'm willing to commit to you.
Ha ha
I dont get it. Do you mean to say, I hate everyone? That feels so negative so Im not inclined to believe it directly.
I think you can easily post this on r/TwoSentenceHorror with perhaps some slight adjustments.
just realized oh my god I cant unsee it help
You misspelled "suicide".  And "everyday".  This should have been on a horror forum

Well it's not surprising you get paid that highly then, construction is a high risk job, but that still doesn't mean everyone in the world is willing to do that. Any job that pays well and will hire anyone, usually has some sort of major downside that most people aren't happy doing. A construction job for example could easily kill you, it's literally the only reason you're paid highly if they hire literally anyone. Most highly paid jobs don't hire anyone and everyone.
Let me rephrase thats. Its a job, but its not a career.
I work construction. We hire anyone and everyone.
How is working at McDonalds not a real job?

How do I shorten this one then? Bearing in mind, I'm no professional at one liners like some people on here.

I really hate that I keep hearing this bullshit. I make 45k a year. I didnt go to college. Im 22 years old and I have a house. McDonalds will not pay your bills, thats how it is, thats how its always been. Get a real fucking job and stop being lazy.

btw, I don't take myself seriously so no one else should either. If my comment sounded highbrow or snobbish, that was part of the joke.  I love language and I'm a big Monty Python fan. 

Humor is the "amuse bouche" of language - just marinate in it and spread the fun.  If something doesn't make you laugh, then just move on to the next dish.

If you missed the humor (and continue to do so), then I regret to inform you that, no, you did not understand the post right away.

It *is* possible to under how something might be funny, but not find it so yourself - but you aren't quite there.

You're just in denial that you missed the joke.
Why are you trying to gatekeep fucking WIT because YOU didn't get a joke?

Holy insecurity, Batman!

Just because you read a sentence that you understood doesn't mean that it's witty.

And reading a book *next* to a dog, is man's best "mend".
Jfc. I bet you like trains.
I got a chuckle from it - I think I can explain.  

The original idiom refers to ease of *producing* something (the low **cost**, e.g. an empty promise) by the bearer.  This joke plays with an alternate meaning as it considers, from the perspective of the *recipient*, the low **value** of idle chatter. By using economic measures and terms to substantiate the claim, it is slightly disarming (but at once immediately intuitive to most listeners) to discover that we hear more words in daily life than we wish to.  Thus, talk must also be cheap (low in price) follow longstanding economic principles at work in our society at a grander scale - those that govern gold, stocks, oil, toilet paper...

And if you're still reading this, you'll realize all the more, no doubt with some sense of exasperation, that I've done nothing more than make the same point as the OP.  :-)
Thats shocking

Thank you, Groucho Marx. Amazing that joke is almost 100 years old, and its still great.

So much edge. Such joke.
I can attest that there's Pizza so bad it's functionally inedible.

Bought a frozen one once that was apparently made with flour that was stretched with laundry detergent powder. Worst thing was that it would have been my last meal before having to catch a plane back home, so I didn't even have time to go get something else to eat.
Gazpacho is salsa that is also just acceptable to eat with a spoon. Prove me wrong

Just once in a while, I want to see a joke on Reddit that isnt just, Haha Im lonely and I jerk off.
U/UnintentionalGrammarNazi
Yeah but op was wrong the joke has been told 1000 times over and every time they say "punctuation is the difference" not "capitalization is the difference"  its proper to change Uncle and Jack to capitals but it's not what makes the difference "helping your Uncle Jack off a horse" is a miss use of capitalization because without the punctuation Jack is still a verb it just has an unnecessary capital
Captitalism
It changes the meaning, is the point. At least it's what I understood by what OP said.
Yes but when you read "helping your uncle jack off a horse" and "helping your Uncle Jack off a horse" you would say them the exact same way because capitalization does not effect the way we pronounce things while punctuation does
Well I mean it's sort of important, though. A combination of properly placed commas and a capital J in the right place changes the meaning. It has to become a noun somehow.
I didn't get the capital mixed up it was autocracy on the second one I was trying to prove the point that capitalization doesn't actually change how its said
At least you didnt make a total ass of yourself
I think it would be "Helping your uncle, Jack, off a horse" and "Helping your uncle jack off a horse". You got the capital J mixed up and dropped a comma. I could be wrong, though. I'm not an English teacher.
Didnt see that coming
Nudist beach - full of tits, bums and pricks
Capitalization.
Capitalization. You read it as capitalism.
Happily, nobody cares
Not really. Suicides often inspire other vulnerable, depressed people to do the same. So not true, and definitely not funny.
But where does capitalism fit in?
Obviously this one time you are...
Right, because people will pay for the second one?
Morning wood and arthritis
You said a mouthful.
So dark
No these sentences would be said the exact same way punctuation is the difference between "helping your uncle jack, off a horse" and "helping your uncle Jack off a horse"
Only if the horse has an onlyfans. 
Almost.

Helping your uncle, Jack, off a horse.

Neither of those two are correct at all, because off a horse is subordinate to the helping your uncle. Jack is a nonessential word, which we separate from the rest of the sentence, using commas.
I want to find and hit you
Funny? Sad but true.
Would you preferWould you like to eat out, Grandma? Or, would you like to eat out Grandma?
Actually its more like punctuation. 

Uncle Jack, off vs Uncle, Jack off.
You spelt capitalism wrong
&gt;Posts must be oneliners.

Hey OP, you are younger than most men who are 52. So it's not that bad!

Dont overthink it. I was gonna say this sub is for funny non-sequiturs but do I really give enough of a shit to police a post on Reddit? Yes I do. You might wanna stop over by hashtag randomthoughts, unless theres a joke here Im missing. We good? We good.

 it was the breast time of my life.

it's not even a joke it's just a statement
Not bad. Not bad.
I'll take a laugh any way I can get it! Bad attention is still attention ;)
You do get that the "death" is incidental to the joke and not the point of it?  Wishing upon a star is a known childhood innocent thing, and the joke comes from subverting the innocence.  Elon or jeff are the butt of the joke because 1. Punching up makes for a wider audience appeal, and 2. *the joke only works if the butt of the joke could be confused for a shooting star i.e. someone burning in re-entry*.  All of this in a one sentence package.

If you think there's actual malice here, well, people in glass idiots and all...

The origin of the word seems to come from the ancient Vulvaic monasteries, where the nuns and lay sisters developed this bad habit while bathing together, and the monks who lived nearby overlooked it, as they did not want to let a good thing slip out of their hands.
If your erection wins you an election does that make you a poll-vaulter?

I had read that if a service dog approaches you, it is looking for help and you should follow it back to its master.  This may be a blind person who has fallen or some other situation where the dog needs another human.  The bottom line is - always check it out.

Nice straw man argument.

Fundamentally, Rule 1 explicitly states that there's nothing wrong with this post.

That said, sure, we can move on :) have a nice day.
*sigh*    Okay, sure, I'm an ass who hates humor and kicks puppies, whatever you say. We have a fundamental disagreement about the definition of the term "one-liner." I'm content to agree to disagree and move on. Please do the same.
Actually it has 1 downvote (at time of writing), and it came from you :) dude, what's your problem? The guy posted a joke and you act like this? You really need to get out and socialize a bit more, I bet you're a right laugh at parties.
THIS COMMENT has 2 downvotes, man. Jeez.
Just spreading bad vibes I guess ;)
Funnily enough, looks like you can't do the math. You're the only one who downvoted here :) and if you're so bitter, why you in a joke subreddit?
\*hard wank

FTFY
Funnily enough, looks like I'm not the only one disagreeing and down voting.
Downvoted me because you're wrong? XD lmao
I'm sorry, but what part of Rule 1 don't you understand? It says "Some jokes that are written in two sentences are allowed as long as the second sentence is a short punchline."
I'm sorry, but what part of "ONE-LINER" is so hard to understand? 

If a joke has a setup and a punchline, then it definitely has more than ONE LINE.

Good one. "People swimming in the rivers of Paris or Cairo are either insane or in denial" Cleaner maybe? This removes the logical problem of and/or and the tense problem of 'having swum' in past tense, but currently 'being in'.

Sandwiches were invented in 1762 but Bill Burr did a great bit about having to put the mayo on his sandwich himself at a sandwich shop, and i don't think anyone was telling that joke in the 1800s.
Well, unless he was writing jokes about sex on elevators while he was still wearing diapers, then he doesnt deserve credit for this joke! I heard this joke back in primary/elementary school, I remember telling it to my parents who had already heard it years before that!
This joke has definitely been around a lot longer than Bo Burnham. Both sex and Elevators have been around a lot longer than the Internet and television. To even think that a person that was born well after the year 1900, was the first person to come up with this joke is incredibly naive.

If you can evidence a  earlier use of it, I'll retract it.

Yeah, ending a sentence with a proposition is something you should be ashamed of... Uh, pal.
on a different note because I grieves me that folks (not OP) keep saying that you can't, here's an annoying paste from merriam-webster  
  
Ending a sentence with a preposition such as "with," "of," and "to," is permissible in the English language. There are theories that the false rule originates with the early usage guides of Joshua Poole and John Dryden, who were trying to align the language with Latin, but there is no reason to suggest ending a sentence with a preposition is wrong. Nonetheless, the idea that it is a rule is still held by many.
very well done.  
My hat, sir
A proposition is one word you should never end a sentence withuh, buddy.
My bad

So that whole thing does bother me because I used to work with developmentally disabled people, but I shouldnt really be getting my panties in a bunch about it because I deliberately say offensive non-PC things all the time myself.

Anyway if you are just going to keep saying that, basically whats going to happen here is well all just be getting to watch myself talk to myself. Which is okay with me.

I did mean what I said earlier. I think youre probably alright.
lol sped
I mean I dont see that as being a particularly good joke but its okay. Its valid, basically well timed, so on and so forth. But yeah, Im a big boy, I can acknowledge that your whole initial position here is basically valid, I dont agree with certain aspects of it and I certainly dont agree with how you went about it. But I can respect your position. I certainly respect your perseverance in this stupid game. If you think youre in my head though in a bad way that would be wrong, this is all just interesting to me. But I mean it seriously, I think youre probably a decent guy and its okay that you were trying to stand up for people who you felt I was bullying. Its all fine. Im probably still going to keep responding to things, but Im done downvoting you and Im done getting riled up. Shit happens.
it feels good to be so deep inside you

Well i didnt mean it to be hurtful as there are crude jokes all over the internet, all the time. I know how women have been treated poorly for centuries but some jokes just arent going to be politically correct and you shouldnt let that offend you. This is reddit and even darker jokes than this exist everywhere. They can still be funny even if theyr insulting another race/sex/whatever but that doesnt mean that the person posting the joke or the joke itself is actually racist/sexist/whateverist, they just posted it because its funny. Sorry for offending you, have a good night.
I'm not trolling, but I'm also not trying to hurt you. Your comment is clever, but it is also hurtful. I'm trying to defend and protect women from sexism. This post also feeds into the "men are pigs" stereotype, and that's not fair to men just like it is not fair to women. I can answer any questions you have about it, if you want.
Listen, this isnt sexism. This is crude humor. Please remember this is reddit, not twitter and you may see JOKES like this. It does not mean that i think less of women. Please learn to take a joke, not everything will be politically correct for you.
I genuinly do not know if these comments about sexism are trolling or not please send help.
I agree! This is sexist.
This isnt sexism m'lady this is a joke
Your question "where does it say..." is completely beside the point. Sexism is sexism is sexism. And you are doing exactly that - excusing and defending sexism.
I didn't say that; I am asking you where does it say that all "oneliners" should be PC? I am not excusing sexism, but it is a oneliner. Just because something makes you uncomfortable, doesn't mean we should stifle free speech and creativity.
Excusing sexism by saying "it's not against the rules" is stupid. Don't bully women, or anyone. It's just not right, no matter what your "rules" allow.
Where does it say that oneliners should be politically correct? Maybe start your own subreddit dedicated to politically correct oneliners?
This ain't it chief
[here sir](www.google.com/search?q=fuckingvirgin)
Just in case you're unaware, this is sexist objectification of women. It is both morally wrong and politically incorrect. It makes you look bad and hurts women, especially if they're self-conscious. It's a shame this kind of outdated, toxic thinking still exists.

To any women reading this, not all men think this way. There are great men out there who will love you no matter what you look like. I am a flat-chested woman who is happily married. I know being objectified like this can hurt. You're not alone. Many men prefer a partner with similar interests. Be yourself, find someone who likes the things you like, someone you can talk to, and you will be far more likely to be happy. Wise men and women understand this. Only a fool is interested in someone solely based off of something as temporary as looks.
Oh. My. God. *Facepalm*

Yeah that's the joke, actually. That's not why it's called the funny bone, the funny bone isn't actually a bone, it's the ulnar nerve. That bone is called the humerus for a different reason
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus
No I'm pretty sure it's called the funny bone because of the ulnar nerve in your elbow. When you bump your elbow, it feels funny.
Your one liner is more of a scientific fact. I don't know if that was intended, but the reason it's called the funny bone is because its scientific name is the humerus.

Going by the comment, wherever you got them, they seem to be doing the job lol.

I postulate you're right.
There's a musical instrument called a [crwth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crwth). It's pronounced "crooth" (rhymes with tooth). There are several Welsh-derived words that use w as a "oo" vowel.

Similarly, I had a friend try to convince me that "jiggly" has 3 syllables.
Sometimes, yeah. Iirc whether a letter is a vowel or consonant depends on what sound it's making, and Y can make both vowel or consonant sounds.

I never would have thought about pronouncing oil with one syllable until I read that comment, some accents just aren't that common in other places
How is it possible that one could even argue about those things?

Mind blown.
Y counts as a vowel, so syllable could still say it has 3 vowels
Ehhh its kinda borderline and has to do with accent. Its along the same lines as oil and fire
theres an argument to be made that those could be one or two syllables
Yep! It's pronounced as, Y-ILD
Not a native. Is wild 2 syllables?

Youre a really dumb person who came in here out of nowhere to try to bully someone, which you actively acknowledge and seem to be proud of, because you think they were bullying other people, but all I was ever doing was at worst being condescending. Your initial comment was already way over the line and wildly disproportionate to anything I had said to anyone else. You are a stalker, and a bully, and you should not be happy about that. I suspect you are not really happy about anything, because I assume you have no real friends.

You dont get to make my phone go off whenever you want, because Im now blocking you except to check in once in a while.

Yeah, so what just happened is, I planted the uncle comment to see if you were dumb and giddy enough to think that you were the clever one by noticing that you could call me inbred because of it, and you walked right into it. And now everyone knows that you walk into things. Congratulations, Mr. Magoo

A 401K is a standard company's retirement program. Long-distance foot races in America use the metric system to define how far you run (a 5K or a 10K - five kilometers or ten kilometers). The joke is that OP has confused the retirement plan with a race - they think they're signing up to run 401 kilometers.
This is a cracking one liner congrats!

What is a oneliner?  
A oneliner is a succinct, funny or witty remark. The joke should fit into one or two sentences.
Rule 1;  
Posts must be oneliners.  
Generally oneliner is a joke that is written in one sentence. Some jokes that are written in two sentences are allowed as long as the second sentence is a short punchline. If your post does not meet this requirement, it will be removed.
Just because you can fit it in the title doesn't make it a oneliner

You give kids toothpaste at Halloween don't you.
It would stop a lot of nasty divorces.

Jury: After reviewing the social media evidence we, the jury, find person A to be extremely promiscuous and person B to be narcissitic. Marriage denied.
And funerals, honestly.

Yep, its more of the chewy texture than the taste I guess. Kinda like chewing gum or playing with a fidget spinner, so it could just be a mindless activity that makes drinking the beverage more fun. 

Also, thanks for saying hipster juice. I chuckled

God. Fucking. Damnit. Take your upvote.
I dont even know what the fuck is the rage. I ask what the boba things make the drink taste like. Their reply (that is - everyones reply is that it tastes like nothing). So you spend money on the bubble tea to get boba that tastes like nothing, filled to at least 1/4 of the cup, the rest filled with whatever drink they put in the blender. Thats just hipster juice.

I'm not gonna play your psycho game where all of a sudden youre the victim after being the source of evil
Nobody even knows who I am, why the fuck would I give a shit about having the points themselves. Im trying to share one of my favorite one-liners and get people to look into Rodney, and some people come along and bitch about it, yeah, its annoying, and yeah, Im going to retaliate. But you go ahead and keep playing with that straw, man. At the end of the day when someone just goes after you for sounding smart, its a good bet you actually won no matter what the peanut gallery may say. Teehee.
yeah my friend it's exactly as I said. enjoy your internet fame (bfd) and make sure to straighten your posture so you appear higher on your horse as you look down your nose at the world.
You mentioned the word 'joke'. Chuck Norris doesn't joke. 
Here is a fact about Chuck Norris: 

 &gt;Chuck Norris's keyboard doesn't have a Ctrl key because nothing controls Chuck Norris.
The joke, which I gave credit for instantly, is already in 8th place for the last week in only eleven hours. So Im pretty much done arguing about the one-liner or not question. Clearly the audience is on my side. And the reason I sound smart is because I am. Sort of like how you taste like a turd.
you need to chill the fuck out. your joke sucks for this subreddit. then you stick your nose in the air like a snob and try to talk smart and speak down to people. garbage my friend. you know what else good comedians do? they read their audience.  youre getting boo'd off stage. and all you're doing is parroting/plagiarizing for internet points, real high and mighty sir

The stool was uosid down.
I wanted to have it there, but it seems this subreddit does not allow subtext, only title. I almost put it in the title but looking at it I felt it slightly took away from the humor. So I put it as this comment immediately. I assumed this would get upvotes enough to keep it displaying at the top. I am disappointed it has not because I have no interest in making anyone think it was my joke; my motivation is making people know about one of my favorite jokes, and hopefully even causing people who dont know Rodney to look into him in general.
You really should out this in the actual post.

Yes, sometimes. Having to deal with pedantry that is not even based in reality (a form of arrogance itself) would certainly be something that tends to bring that out in me.
/r/holup is currently better at posting Dangerfield one liners than you are: https://www.reddit.com/r/HolUp/comments/opq56j/a_classic/
Lol. Youre certainly the arrogant prick type, arent you?
No one is saying some non-one-liners dont make it in here  your post proves that.
Study the real world and the history of comedy outside of Reddit, and youll eventually discover that one-liner comedy was defined long before the internet, in a way that does not agree with your literal, rigid, and foolish definition.
Not only that, but the first statement is its own sentence, regardless of the comma. This is simply a joke. Its not a oneliner. Its a short joke, but a full-fledged normal joke nonetheless.
Beep!
No, I moved the statement and added more detail to another comment that popped up and was more relevant. And youre definitely not the sharpest bulb in the cookie jar if you think that this subreddits posts are the best place to look to figure out what a one-liner is, just because thats the title. Reality is more complicated than that.
Some other user just said it, but sort this group by best posts and youll see the difference. You can wish for your twoliner to be a oneliner all you want, but its not. It literally has a period in the middle.
You mentioned the word 'joke'. Chuck Norris doesn't joke. 
Here is a fact about Chuck Norris: 

 &gt;Chuck Norris uses tabasco sauce instead of visine.
The vast majority of jokes that have ever been called one-liners are two lines, delivered as such even if they could feasibly be written as one sentence on paper. This joke, you would know if youd ever seen it, is also delivered as just two lines. And most jokes generally considered one-liners are still setup-punchline as well. Take my wife... please!
Sorry, bud. This objectively not a oneliner. It has a setup and a punchline. Literally a twoliner.
[deleted]
I think it could be trimmed into a one liner though.

Maybe *A girl told me to come over to her house as there was nobody home, but I didnt expect her to be so literal about it.* ?
Ouch
This is just a joke dude. Poor punctuation doesn't make it a one liner, sorry.

When i midlife I want buy an porche too
I don get it
This is bugging me, because it doesnt work! Saying it out loud, you pronounce sin two ways, and in writing, pie is spelled differently. So neither way is it a smooth switch in meaning. Also, if eating a whole pie is sin of pie, then eating a cake should be sin of cake, which is obviously meaningless.
Come on, that was a hoot.
As a bald man, I can confirm this. Beard trimmings are a necessity
What a cheesy joke
They're rolling on the flour loafing
I like this; did you come up with it?  If I were to give advice I'd change the second half to "but eating pie is never a sin: the sin of pie is zero"
Your reply was funnier than the one liner. Haha

high iq meme
The hurtful to funny ratio isn't quite where it needs to be.
I mean i did say it's still fine, not it's still good ;)
Yeah, but then its a really clunky one liner and would just work better as a two liner anyway.
Also you can replace that period with a comma and it's still fine
Sin is a trigonometric ratio where (in a right angle triangle) you take the opposite side to the angles length upon the hypotenuse of the triangle.

sin(x) has different values for any value of x between 0 and 90. However there is a way to extend this range, and that is through radians. Radians are counted in terms of , or pi. 

Basically in radians, =180. So if we wanted to write sin(60) in radian it would be:

sin(60)=sin(/3)=sin(180/3)

And through calculations we know that sin of 0 and 180 will always be 0. So we can say that sin()=0. 

The joke here is that sin() is pronounced as sin of pi when we say it out loud so you can't commit gluttony by eating pi(e) because sin of pi (sin()) is equal to zero.
Eating too much pie makes you pious 
I wish I had better than a grade 9 so I could get the joke 
We shutter to think.
TIHU
MATH!
W-what are you doing sin-of-pi?
Omg, fuck you dude
eating half/whole cake should be free of sin.
No it's a decimal

Are jokes only allowed to be told by the person who came up with it? No. I'm not gaining anything that any comedian is losing.
No, you don't have to be. Just relax and be yourself, not a copy of someone you saw on TV.
Makes sense
One of two:

A. Exposing thief. Would you share someone's drawing without crediting them? (or did you?) Why is it OK to steal a joke? And just for some internet points.

OR

B. You were actually trying to share a good humor to make some other Redditors day better, not having one of your own, you used established comedian. So you might as well give your fellow redditors source so they can get more.

What is YOUR point?

Go for the juggler is a complete sentence on its own. When attacked by clowns is not. 

I dont know what school of thought you are referring to. Its been a while since I took English comp, but my understanding is that this is pretty clear cut.
No, I get that. Theres just a school of thought that neither makes any actual sense alone, and the first clause is also missing any actional verb. Go for the juggler is a sentence, but it doesnt really relate to the point on its own. When attacked by a mob is technically a sentence but is fragmented.
It does need the comma. When attacked by clowns is a dependent clause, so it should be followed by a comma.
Arguably it doesnt even need a comma. Either would probably be accessible, but as it stands its a mess.
As opposed to the patriarchal seaman.
No, its one line, improperly punctuated. It should have a comma instead of a period.

That's true too. Lol the omelette. Thank-you for being respectful, I appreciate it.
Oh, you'll get no blowback from me regarding that. I appreciate you telling me about the origins of latke. I imagine, though, that some others probably independently came up with the idea or a version of it throughout the centuries. Kinda like with the omelette. As a young teenager, I thought I'd invented it. Was crushed the first time I saw them on a menu. :/
A lot of traditional Jewish food has been plucked over the course of 3000 years and given new names. I'm tempted to call it cultural appropriation but we've been sharing food with others for that long anyway, it's part of the culture. I just want people to remember the food's roots, that's all.

In my first job, at a design agency in the UK, we used to put together ads for Electrolux Vacuum Cleaners.

&gt;iirc earth is closer to oval than round

Depending on your definition, but Earth is only imperceivably oval if we shrunk it down to basketball size. In fact, Earth is more round/spherical than almost all balls we would ever see in our life even if you include the all the geographical terrain features. Only high precision balls specifically manufactured for optical/scientific use would be more spherical than Earth.
I'm not genius but I think you are right
Have an upvote for trying to educate as well as entertain.

FYI: Actually, the full quote is: "The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb." 

The original meaning of the phrase was blood shed on the battlefield creates a stronger bond between soldiers than simple familial or genetic ties.

In principle, it means friendships you choose are stronger than genetic ties to your family.
I mean we probably define colour with that particular wavelength and colour blind or not, we can extract that info from photos.

If you want to get technical about it, iirc earth is closer to oval than round.

That is actually a great single-sentence summary of survivorship bias
This sentence is grammatically correct. Just because nobody complains doesnt mean all parachutes are perfect. The only fix they could make to it would be a that after the word mean. The sentence means that just because you dont see anybody complaining about ineffective parachutes, does not mean that there are none.
Yes, the tree does make a sound.
For Sale: Parachute, used only once. Small brown stain.
Kind of funny but I handled parachutes on Airborne operations. Some of those people complained.a lot.
It's confusing because OP uses a double negative in the sentence. But my take is that the complaints or words of concern are silenced by a bigger force. In this analogy, the ones who had a problem with their parachutes never made it safe to the ground, so their cries were never heard.
Its only for when youre absolutely baked
Can someone explain this to me? Seems very useful but I dont quite understand it.
Just because nobody heard them complaining doesn't mean they didn't...

The 'height' of the plateau is defined by its altitude. Many plateaux in the American southwest are indeed tall, from base to top; but are not high, as their base is below sea level.

I think this one is both a joke and a random thought. I read the description in the about section of r/oneliners and I believe this fits.

&gt; a oneliner is a succinct, funny or witty remark. The joke should fit into one or two sentences.

It doesn't define "joke" very well, but I believe this post is fitting to r/oneliners. The main aspect we want for r/oneliners imo is a punch in a single short sentence. This post does that well if you ask me.

In quebec, instead of using immdiatement, we say tout de suite, cuz you know, we butcher languages. A lot.
Suite refers to a large hotel room

Without using Google, or going to my cupboard, the only Nestle brands I can think of with 100% certainty are Nescafe coffee, and Purina pet food. I know they make bottled water, and baby formula, but I don't know what brand (without cheating and looking). 

I do know Hershey's Kisses. Also I had a chocolate Labrador Retriever named Hershey.

As a Canadian, I would consider Nestle a pre-packaged food company before a chocolate brand.

This is so much better than what it is actually called

 - Remys Delicious Restaurant 

 (Itadakimouse) actually preserves the original pun (RATatouille) in a way that naturally fits in Japanese. Its brilliant.

ok. but that still doesnt mean that there is likely to be a level of american-centric content.
fwiw i am also from nyc and ive heard of ritter sport. but that doesnt negate the fact that hershey is a huge company with international reach, and also this is an american website so its not at all unreasonable to have american-centric shit on it.
pssst Reddit users are from all around the world

Oh no, I didn't avoid shit lol. I just tell you something you, for some reason, want to ignore with all your soul
And you want to keep avoiding facts presented. Take care of yourself.  Good bye.
Look man, if you're too full of yourself to see it it's not my fault
You havent proven me wrong at all.  You just keep avoiding the facts which are presented and keep saying no.  No argument.   Hershey is the 2nd most popular candy brand even over nestle as per the links provided. Anyway, Im done here.  I take back all my arguments because as i said you probably havent heard of half the shit in the world as your country probably just opened up in the last decade or so.  Take care of yourself and travel a bit and see the world.
I hate all of you

No, that was just a joke after a lot of replies in which I proved you wrong but you stayed firmly on your fallacious reasoning
Ok .. so when losinggo to insults and ignore the facts presented.  Typical.

Yeah I know, it's a very popular european brand, evidently not popular worldwide 
Just passing through here, I agree with you but I lol'ed at your example of 'Ritter Sport.' What even is that!
That's exactly the error you're making. Since you know only americans, try to ask some question in Chatroulette instead of pulling your dick out lol
The numbers prove your original comment wrong.  Is it cold in Ukraine right now?
Exactly, you're only seeing numbers and refusing to get the meaning of my original comment
Ok.  Yes Im using actual data to trick myself.  Ok.  Why not which country?  Also your writing style is Eastern European so no youre not from of the most popular countries, nice try.
You're tricking yourself considering only those numbers. I'm in the one of the most popular eu countries and I doubt you know anybody outside us
Numbers doesn't mean worldwide popularity. You're insisting but missing the point
Numbers is what matters.  2nd most popular candy company WORLDWIDE.  So why dont you want to say what country? Im guessing Ukraine by your writing style.
You're still talking about numbers and completely missing the point, don't embarrass yourself
Wow.. you dont know how to read . The link says its the 2nd most well known candy company world wide.  Who said US is the world?  Did u Read the links?   It says WORLDWIDE not USA !

By your write style i assume youre Eastern European.
Try to read again the thread and to know US is not the whole world
Anyway doesnt matter.  Have a good day.
That is the point. You said its not well known outside the USA but its the second well known candy company worldwide.   What country are u from?  Yes it matters.
That wasn't the point. Also you're blindly insisting
But i proved that wrong already.  Its the 2nd most popular brand WORLD WIDE.  Did you click on the links?  You keep repeating the same thing when its not true. So what country are you from?
Look man, there's no need to insist. Just know that if something is extremely popular in your country (especially in US, cuz sometimes y'all think it's the only country in the world) it doesn't mean it's popular everywhere
Europe is a big place.  Which country?
Europe. But that's not the point
Your point is wrong by the link i provided.  Only you havent heard of it.  where r u from? Asked 3 times already.
Ok maybe that was a wrong example. I'm not american, that was my point
I just gave you proof and you deny it.   No one has heard of Ritter sport . What country are you from?
It's not a race man, it's just that it's not as international and popular worldwide as, let's say, Nestle, Ritter Sport or Lindt
Whats that gotta so with it?  Its still the 2nd most popular chocolate company world wide.   And what country are you from?
You're american, that was my point.
Not exactly.   Its that ONLY you havent heard of it.  Hershey is a world wide brand.

What even does it mean
I hate how long it took me to get this
No it's not, a) I bought a bottle of 12 year old Scotch b) I bought a 12 year old child a bottle of Scotch
Gee, just like on the TV commercial.
Its not even offensive
That must have been hard on you
Ppl to scared to laugh at this?
Yep, you certainly blew in from stupid town.

Your joke isn't working, so move on and live with it.
Perhaps this would clear things up: I bought a bottle of scotch for a 12 year old human child...
&gt; not buying the person as a slave 

But thats the double meaning they are trying to use. Hence why in my opinion, the joke doesnt work. Sometimes jokes dont work. We all have made them. You move on and live with it.
They're obviously referring to buying the minor alcohol, not buying the person as a slave
I struggled with impostor syndrome and being grammatically incorrect and talking about myself in forth person, but what did my friend think about me knewing what I know now that I forgot it?
No. Just smarter than you I guess. The fuck is wrong with everyone. People from Scotland arent called Scotch. Its a stupid term that Americans came up with and everyone thinking this joke works is just as stupid as you
Hey pal, did you just blow in from stupid town?
Glenfiddich makes a nice scotch.

Its not my post. Its not my error. Its not my problem.
Embarrassed by your error, are you?  That's Ok.  Let me explain it to you.  
  
If you had written **"Because - A word to the whys"** it would have made sense, AND been somewhat humorous.  But in the form you posted, it makes no sense, and is NOT funny.
The real question is, why did I feed a troll?
I could have sworn I unsubscribed from r/dadjokes.
So I have to form a complete sentence to criticize a post that NOT a complete sentence?   
Here's another clue for you all: **Why's** is NOT the plural of **why.**
I mean, you're not wrong.
For someone so concerned with grammar, you didnt form your criticism in a full sentence. Its almost like you understood that a very short reply would deliver the comedic effect you intended, much like the OP did with their joke.

Check your local grocer for a sense of humor. Failing that, buy some flowers to brighten up your drab existence.

*"your child? No no no, our child"*
The Roman Church is pretty sure these days that it's more likely to be illness than demonic possession that drives someone to do "bad things", so it doesn't recognise possession as a thing.  


From wikipedia:  


The New Catholic Encyclopedia states, "Ecclesiastical authorities are reluctant to admit diabolical possession in most cases, because many can be explained by physical or mental illness alone. Therefore, medical and psychological examinations are necessary before the performance of major exorcism. The standard that must be met is that of moral certitude (De exorcismis, 16). For an exorcist to be morally certain, or beyond reasonable doubt, that he is dealing with a genuine case of demonic possession, there must be no other reasonable explanation for the phenomena in question."\[17\]

Let's agree to disagree. Eating healthy gives you a long term boost in happiness while eating unhealthy gives you only pleasure at that moment and makes you disgust yourself later.

What a fiercely underrated wholesome post
I think there are moray
It's like that old joke: guy comes to the doctor's office, asks if he could theoretically live up to 100 y.o.
- Do you drink alcohol? - asks the doctor.
- No - answers the guy.
- Do you eat red meat?
- No.
- Do you like to party? To gamble? To stay out all night?
- No, no and no.
- Then why the hell do you want to live up to 100 y.o.?
If you avoid alcohol, red meat, smoking, fast cars, and adrenalin sports you won't necessarily live longer, it'll just seem like it.
Dude

I mean a long pause. Like, you cant set up, then wait a couple seconds for people to think, you say it all one thing. In other words, said in one line
Theres Comma in the post, so theres a pause.
Read the rules to the sub. The punchline doesnt have to overlap, it just has be a breath of speech without pauses
One-liners are whenever the joke and the punchline are one and the same.
One liners can be long as fuck, as long as no one has to speak to you for you to say it
Its all yours.
Probably meant friend. Or maybe he was fried and you owned him

Kudos for not being a pedantic dick.
Can confirm, Im italian, it means strong
I'm french it is supposed to be pronounced that way, but not in English, which like most all languages, learns and grows and adapts words from other languages. There is nothing to correct, but it is an interesting etymological distinction between the two different "fortes".
Doesn't "forte" also mean "strong" in Italian, not just "loud?"
Ah yes. My german autocorrect.

Youll know.
Cheeses ! 
That's no Gouda
She's a muenster
In Canada it's fort, eh?
Just FYI, "forte" as in "strong point" is supposed to be pronounced "fort." Because it's French for the strongest part of a sword. The e is silent. 

The musical pronunciation of "forte" ("fortay") is Italian for "loud."  It's a different word. 

Of course I am not a pedantic dick, so I don't correct people in public. But it's still an interesting etymological distinction.

Noses are simple enough to explain: mucus membranes. 

Now feet are interesting because they have the highest concentration of sweat glands (of which there are about 250,000) of any body part and a pair of feet produce about 1/2 pint of sweat a day. Combine those sweat totals with our propensity to wear synthetic socks and shoes, neither of which breathe, and you have quite the breeding ground for bacteria and sometimes fungus. The waste produced by the bacteria (and sometimes fungus) causes the stank.
I agree that having your thesaurus stolen would be very very very not good.
Yeah, I saw that there and then, no need to worry bro, I was  just joking 
The mod deleted it because it was, and I quote, "two lines".

And nothing will ever be right again. It really is the saddest part knowing theyve moved on like you never existed in their life and you will always wonder what if. Especially when they refuse to allow you or give you the closure you need. The TRUTH. That they are too cowardly to face or to give you the truth. This is a horrible way to live knowing this is your future now. Nothing but pain.

So the Dalai Lama is spiritual, so the joke works! Thanks!
Its a pun. Being one with something means having a spiritual connection to that thing. If you say one with everything at a food vendor, youre asking for a food item with all the extras (condiments, garnishes, etc.)

It's a pun, where "poll" sounds like the word "pole". A pole is a long stick used to hold a tent up, so if you "took a pole" the tent would collapse. If there were people inside the tent and you asked them all how they felt about you knocking it down (i.e. "took a poll"), they would all be pretty angry!

I think that's pretty funny.

Try to imagine yourself in one of their offices. You get your first look at this six foot not a real doctor as they enter. He moves like a bird, lightly, bobbing his head -- and you keep still 'cause you think that maybe his visual acuity is based on movement, like a Physical Therapist; he'll lose you if you don't move -- but no, not Chiropractor. You stare at him, and he just stares right back. 

And that's when the attack comes not from the front, but from the side *swish!* from the other two chiropractors... you didn't even know were there. Because Chiropractors a pack hunter. He used coordinated attack patterns, and he is out in force today. 

And he adjusts you with THIS!  A mid sized Lumbar Pelvic Drop in the middle of the room. 

He doesn't bother to bite your jugular like a ENT, no, no. He realigns at you *here!* or *here*... or maybe above the tail bone, triggering a chain reaction. 

The point is, you are alive, when they start to eat you. So ya know, try to show a little respect.

Its a repeating joke in the Airplane movies.  https://youtube.com/watch?v=InbJGZYlaNE&amp;feature=share.      Like while taking a shot from a flask, I picked the wrong week to stop drinking.
It's like Jesus doesn't even know he's dead and he walks around to people and joins them for prayer and goes to church and preaches to the mass when they are silent in prayer. He thinks people are calling to him when someone says "Oh god." and has a fear of rusty hammers and flocks of sheep with sharp teeth. Through out the whole movie you it shows you clues of bumper sticks and key chains, billboards, little pocket knives and people who can't say "JFC!" say this along with the items inscribed with this phrase, "What would Jesus do?" Yes! What would Jesus do as he ponders this question? Jesus can't understand why people say it when he's standing right there six feet away. At the end he starts to go mad and that's when he realizes he's dead and no one can see him other than new born emo babies and that one homeless guy that he cured. Afterwards he heads over to the strip club for some titty action.
Something just wooshed me here

to be fair it does say generally. and yes it does imply that it is for jokes, but it doesnt explicitly say that it is
Im glad the rule is one line
Unless you look at rule 1: "Generally oneliner is a joke that is written in one sentence..."

Rule one implies that this sub is meant for jokes which are kept to as close to one line as possible. Your quote is very nice though.
Is this guy a professional quote maker?

Quality.
Correct, but to justify, here is rule #1

**1.Posts must be oneliners.**

Generally oneliner is a joke that is written in one sentence. Some jokes that are written in two sentences are allowed **as long as the second sentence is a short punchline.** If your post does not meet this requirement, it will be removed.
But its still something...hence the figure and your post, among much more relevant things.
Well yeah why wouldn't you? We end up with one sock by throwing one away because it had a hole or one of them just grew feet and ran away. I'm pretty sure if I take all this lint I could make another sock to match it with. If your really dedicated you can use two socks filled with nickels and do double damage.
I've always liked this one. Reminds of " she can't cut me off, she doesn't know where I'm getting it from."

It aint nothin but a mistake

["But I'll never forget the way you feel right now, Oh no - no way - I would do anything for love, But I won't do that" - The "that" in this particular verse is "forget the way you feel right now." Meat Loaf said this himself on his Storytellers episode on VH1](https://www.songfacts.com/facts/meat-loaf/id-do-anything-for-love-but-i-wont-do-that)
What is it, exactly, that Meat Loaf wouldn't do?
It ain't nothin' but a heartbreak.

That's not even a joke, we have just a few one ways in my city but the other day I was in the left lane coming up on an intersection around a blind bend, right as another car was driving the wrong way in my way turning right onto the other road. If they hadn't already been turning out of my lane I wouldn't have had much time to stop or swerve out of the way since its a 45mph road.
There is more truth in those words than anyone realizes. Trust me I'm a pedestrian IN THE BRONX!!!!

I'm so little faith left in humanity I stopped looking either way on any Street.
Is this like the terrible "joke" that was doing the rounds when I was at school: 

&gt; "I'm not racist. Racism is a crime, and crime is for black people."
Knowledge is knowing which way to look when crossing a one way street. Wisdom is looking both ways
And never trust indication lights.
I do it too. If anyone ever questions it the reply is Id rather look the idiot than get hit by one.
I live on a one-way, and it is seriously disappointing to see how many people drive it in the wrong direction. This is both a one liner and a LPT lol.
I always do too, but because I read a story about a police car that hit a pedestrian on route to an emergency call, the wrong way along a one way street was the fastest route
I do that, lots of people riding bycicles in the wrong direction here.
I was so cautious as a kid before crossing the road I'd look both ways twice, then check the sky for failing planes.
Grew up on the corner of a highway and a one way street. Absolutely look both ways

It IS bad. Or would you support trimming up an infant girl's labia as well? I mean, she won't remember the pain anyways and then guys will like going down on her more when she's older (&lt;- actual argument I've heard in favour of circumcision, that girls prefer to suck a dick that's circumcised so you should get it done)
And then John Kellogg, of breakfast cereal fame, decided that boys shouldn't masturbate and masturbating is harder when you're cut (uncut = don't need lube) so he launched a campaign to popularize the procedure for "medical reasons" instead of religious ones. There's now several generations of people who think a circumcised penis is what it's *supposed* to look like, and being uncut is weird or gross. If someone launched a campaign to give baby girls a labiaplasty to trim them lips up right after they're born there would be outrage against it, but we continue to perform a medically unnecessary irreversible procedure on infant boy's genitalia because a century ago some rich religious prude decided jerking off is wrong.

Its like a piece of me went missing that day, you know?
I had an adult circumcision and let me tell you, its pretty similar for a grown-up! I had a bandage and stitches that had me walking like I just got off a horse for weeks and weeks.
As a last resort you could just make the hens meat.
I swear Im so fucking dumb. I was wondering how tf it would cause you to be unable to walk and then I realized....oh

The thing is, lots of people wear helmets at their job. Why is Japanese Airforce somehow more funny than motorcycle cop? Does the Japanese Airforce bury their pilots in their helmets? Why not an American soldier, they wear protective helmets. Why not a football player or a hockey player? Their helmets have face protection too.

Is there something inherently funny about Japanese people wearing helmets that I just don't get.

Please explain why you think Japanese people wearing helmets is funny.

Lots of people die wearing helmets. The point is to be buried in your helmet to be more prepared for the zombie apocalypse when you are reanimated as a zombie. Did they bury kamikazes wearing their helmets?
No, in old wars, japanese airforce pilots would drive their planes directly into enemy boats, aircraft carriers etc. so they would sink. this was called kamikaze. in the process, the pilot would also die. pilots wear helmets. they would die wearing their pilot helmets.

Pure genius! 
I initially read this as
They *wont* call the police if I *dont* put it back

Took re-reading 3-4 times, to find my mistake.
I think this would be better if you said "pick up fencing" instead. The initial setup still works as "pick up" has the same connotation

"Been so bored recently, decided to pick up fencing"

but it makes the second half work better imo as I don't hear "take up" as meaning "to lift"

"Been so bored recently, decided to pick up fencing, but my neighbors said they'll call the police if I don't put it back."
"Good fences make good neighbors"
That's offencive

A floppy disk or floppy diskette (sometimes casually referred to as a floppy or diskette) is a type of disk storage composed of a thin and flexible disk of a magnetic storage medium in a square or nearly square plastic enclosure lined with a fabric that removes dust particles from the spinning disk. Floppy disks are read from and written to by a floppy disk drive (FDD).

A local dealer around here who will sell a car to anyone (with a super high interest rate) has a control module installed in their cars. If you are late in your payment it kills the vehicle until you pay up. If you are driving at the time it gets the kill command it will wait for you to shut the car off, the won't allow it to be restarted.

True story here. I'm at a rooftop bar with some friends, had to go down and get something out of my car for one of the friends just before we're leaving. I'm coming back up the elevator and as the door opens at the top my friends have already tabbed out and are waiting to get on the elevator but there are two other people in front of them. They sort of step to the side as they're letting me out, but I just wave them in knowing we're all gonna fit and go down together. This threw the two strangers off a bit so they naturally were like "what are you, the elevator operator?" And so I played along... "Yep, which floor do you need to go to?" "Ground please." Then one of them unintentionally set me up perfectly by saying like "Must be a boring job".... I said "Well... It has it's ups and downs." We all laughed out asses off.

That is why I asked the question cuz when I did the calculations it seemed that the hare will never reach the turtle so I thought I understood it incorrectly lol.
No it's really a trick question. With the data given the hare is actually slowing down. If the first 10 seconds it runs 50 feet, but the second 10 seconds it only runs 25, then 12.5, then 6.25, and so on until infinity, never passing the turtle

But procrastinate anyways. I always say the sooner you fall behind the more time you'll have to catch up.
So is the hare faster by 2x? I am looking to procrastinate studying for my mechanics final and this is better than studying lol
If a turtle and a hare were to race, and the turtle got a 100 ft lead, and we know that the hare will travel half the distance to the turtle every 10 seconds, how long would it take the hare to pass the turtle?

On a perfectly smooth round earth, your horizon would be a circle of a radius of roughly 4-5 km (the exact value depends on your height) and you in its centre. You'd not be able to see beyond that as bits of earth closer to you obstruct the view: your line of sight would have to cross the arc of earth.

If earth was flat and perfectly smooth, horizon would be earth's "edge", which is most definitely further away.

"Perfectly smooth" is a huge simplification, but there's at least one place where it should work ok enough - open ocean.

\- Yes to weekly themed one-liner contests please. It might be sensible if there are 'post the best \[theme\] joke' or 'post the best \[insert one-liner comedian\] joke' for existing jokes and then separate ones focusing on writing new jokes which can't be found elsewhere. Perhaps some where you have to finish a joke or write a new punchline to an existing joke might be good variations. 

\- Anything else to add more of a format to the way the place works and encourage post formats beyond just individual jokes which come and go quickly, so there are at least some posts which hang around for longer and encourage comments and more of a community.

I know this is a joke thread, but its actually a thing. We call them frequent fliers and they are people who literally only go back to substance abuse to qualify for rehab again. 

As a mental health professional, I can basically break down why. 
1. They feel safe in rehab. The environment is structured and predictable. Depending on the pay source, it could be a alternative to homelessness. 

2. They are chronically lonely. Too many mistakes in live have stripped them from their family and friends. Rehab offers at least somewhat positive social support. 

3. They get medications they need to balance their other health issues. I have yet to meet an addict who did not have multiple other chronic health issues. 

4. This is not a comprehensive list, and there are several other perfectly valid reasons that someone could become addicted to rehab.


Mental health is not a joke.
There are no examples of nothing.
Haha, thats just cheesey.

You could theoretically say this joke is about a trans man ftm, but then the whole post-man part of the joke becomes a bit of a stretch, requiring an implied op or something similar between the two words. But yeah, this joke could be handled a lot more tactfully

On the real tho I think about this a lot. Like when people say things wont change. For things to be the way they are now, they have had to have changed from some earlier point before they were the way they are. So if things happened to change things then, then things can change AGAIN! One thing we can count on is change.

**[Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo)**

"Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo" is a grammatically correct sentence in English, often presented as an example of how homonyms and homophones can be used to create complicated linguistic constructs through lexical ambiguity. It has been discussed in literature in various forms since 1967, when it appeared in Dmitri Borgmann's Beyond Language: Adventures in Word and Thought. The sentence employs three distinct meanings of the word buffalo: as a proper noun to refer to a specific place named Buffalo, the city of Buffalo, New York, being the most notable; as a verb (uncommon in regular usage) to buffalo, meaning "to bully, harass, or intimidate" or "to baffle"; and as a noun to refer to the animal, bison (often called buffalo in North America). The plural is also buffalo.An expanded form of the sentence which preserves the original word order is: "Buffalo bison that other Buffalo bison bully also bully Buffalo bison."

Lol we dream with all our other senses, just like how things are now. Of course that varies, as some people have more or less sight than others, or had sight in the past and lost it. I still have experiences in dreams if that's what you're wondering? I once had a nightmare my house was on fire. I could hear it and smell it and taste it, because it was so there. I ran out of the house, and so did everyone else but my mom. I did not need sight to experience this nightmare.
Dam good choice also.

As /u/TheGreatWhodiniYT said, they used to make them, and they were a bit crap. An updated version using an NFC tag (or even QR code) might be an idea though, as that could contain all the info needed rather than just using it to look something up like with a standard barcode.
Theyve been made, they require frequent software updates, are made by startups with little prospect for longevity, and are ungodly expensive. Microwaves should just come with a menu in the display that is expansive and relying on humidity sensors. There are some from the 90s that are better than most out there today because they relied on humidity and not time when auto cooking.

Thank you, I understood OP's joke, I was confused by the comment posted by the user above me, hence why I responded to that instead of making a standalone comment.
I think this is excusable because it could be made into one sentence by just changing the punctuation. You dont even have to move any words. Plus, it would sound like one sentence if read out loud anyways.
*obviously.. 
  
as a man Im obviously a tiny bit better at it

I still remember back when this sub was smaller, people actually only posted oneliners
Jemaine: Nah, my *father's* a women's rights activist.

Bret: Your *dad*?

Jemaine: Yeah.

Bret: Not your mum?

Jemaine: No. *Dad wouldn't allow that*.
wlw means woman-loving-woman. It was posted on reddit, so we don't know the gender of the person who posted it. Given that it was posted on oneliners and the person's username is nicebloke we can guess that it's a joke and they're male, but in general it's best to specify.

Basically what would have made my point more clear from the beginning is that the "as a man" helps specify that they're saying that they're better *because* they're male, and not because of some other factor (like the wife not caring so much).

A fish swam into a wall and said "dam"

1) Agreed, but I fixed that in another comment.

2) But there is no reason why you can't. "Contrary to what your high school English teacher told you, there's no reason not to begin a sentence with but or and; in fact, these words often make a sentence more forceful and graceful."

3) To you.
1) Not a oneliner.
2) Do not start a sentence with but.
3) The premise of the joke is confusing.
I liked it!
I don't vthink there's anyone else that small
Okay, you won. You found It even funier than me
Your boomerang is also slow like your upper thing?
Guess that's on me for expecting the "but" part of a one-liner to reinforce the first half rather than contradict it.
That doesn't really work. It could easily be a normal wlw couple, one of whom is a bit more involved in feminism.
Both the husband and wife are in agreement that men and woman are equal. However, the husband is saying that he's better at agreeing men and women are equal because he's a man (and therefore better than a woman).
I don't get it.
comma abuse is the second big offense here. not to be a dick.  this sub just lacks quality one liners
Surely that was a bolt from the purple would be a funnier payoff?

Yes.  Now get yourself on Mars.  The difference is that he may achieve it and you almost certainly will not.

Almost everyone could achieve something great.  Few will.

What possessed you to post this to r/oneliners?

The term _lunacy_ actually does come from the name Luna, as it was believed that the full moon caused people to become crazy. The words _lunatic_ and _looney_ are also derived from Luna.

Whats that?  Ive never heard of it.
Being born gets you a head in life. I dont know of anybody living without a head.

But you missed the fact that Biden was actually offering $2000 for votes in the Georgia Senate elections.  However to be fair, you had to vote for TWO of his parties candidates, so it was only $1000/vote.

But trust me ill be voting Trump in the next election! We heard he pays better for votes than Biden. Still, easiest $1000 USD i ever made. I can finally pay off my igloo mortgage before summer comes!!! Winning!
Stfu, first rule about CanMex wall is you don't talk about .... fking jebus I fked it up. Again. God dammit now we have to come up with a new name. 6 months of negotiations up in smoke.

Linguistically not how it reads though. Information presented earlier in English sentences is generally interpreted as more important.

Moreover "The skin should not be" implies that the skin is something that can be changed.
if x equals y then y equals x. their teeth should not be black.

Feel like this is an awkward one regardless of how you phrase it. But it's even worse considering you seemed to put the emphasis on a permanent thing that a person can't control (skin color), rather than the actual condition that can be controlled to an extent (oral hygiene).
A one liner would have just been the second sentence by itself. Still funny though!

Not sure if that is a comment or a question.  I think Hamlet once said, "A quote is more important than what it says."
Thanks Jimmy Carr
get into someone's panties means getting them to take their panties off (so you can have sex).

But in this case, he was literally trying to fit into her panties himself.

Sorry buddy, smash has a sex connotation, while you grab onto those French Champagne Glass covered titties, you're thinking they'll shard fatally into her throat, which inspired your coffin comment, the Prince in Snow White is a glass coffin robber who performs a grab and smash.  Why you specify glass as a coffin material is more than respect for the OP's sex partner, it's your invitation to extend the OP's word play Smash and Grab to death.

I'm afreud I can't help you either.
Its like using the word dream in 2 different ways. So the 1st way is like follow your dreams and going for the things you want all that stuff. The 2nd way is an actual dream and showing up to school naked is a common dream and is referenced in media a lot. So you think his original statement of Im going to follow my dreams would be something good but it turned out literal and bad and him going to school naked which subverts expectations which is what a joke often is.

There are logged elements of conversation well before your feet let footprints. You sound like a reasonable person who had been hacked.
I can even quote it for you if you want me to.
Listen up mate, i just wan't you to know that sometimes in life you get critisized but that dosen't mean you should get aggressive and berrate people, which you untill not have done.
,
No
Well, you brought it up, didn't you?
You are perceptive in suspecting that these might be unrelated.
And what "unrelated toxins" are you so sure i have?
"Who hurt you" should not be forsaken to become a trademark captured by one motivated and focused advocacy.

Many have been harmed in multiple ways, often by family dynamics. If you want to get your branding right, let it be free of unrelated toxins. Just saying.
Wow, you really are a hypocrite, buddy. What i mean is that you should really learn to take critisism without "finding feces at people, as a power private would".
There are many forms of inflicting harm, and far more of receiving that violence meted. If it satisfy your sociological or political strategy to reduce harm: that is worthwhile.

Marking a common phrase as a secret trademark should not trigger a cascade of condemnation. To this moment, I still don't get what the fuck you mean. WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN???

Fling feces at me, as would a lower primate, for an offense; not for a perception.

Well, at least youre still armed...with wit.
Go ahead. 

I had deleted the root comment as a matter of routine removal, without having given sufficient regard to potential daughter or derivative comments.

On a technical analysis plane of examination: if someone asks, "who hurt you?": other than within dedicated web relief, online that seldom originates from a sense of compassion and care.

You might, or not, accept that this were taken as an aggressive trolling tool.

I would ask you to look into a mirror. Like all you see?
I used to think so, but now I'm not so sure.

If you had any access to passwords or sensitive corporate information, they will dismiss you immediately and rob you of those two weeks, leaving you in the awkward position of up to 4-5 weeks between paychecks where you may have been counting on a seamless transition to your new job.

You're correct it's a very old saying which dates back to a time when buying a dozen of something for a dime was not unheard of.  Calling something a dime "a dozen is saying" it's an over common good and thus has little value or merit in interest.

The joke here is on how dated the idiom is in that virtually nothing can be bought by the dozen for only a dime.  I will patiently wait for someone to prove me wrong about this :-D

I have actually heard people say "a dollar a dozen" which would be taking into account inflation a small bit but that still falls short of describing how the expression was intended in minimizing something by pointing out how commonly acquired it is.

It's supposed to be three separate people that taught him to never use oxford commas. 1. Mrs. Henderson, 2. His English teacher, and 3. a first-rate whore. However, because he doesn't use the oxford comma, Mrs. Henderson is now both his English teacher and a first-rate whore given the punctuation and the structure of the sentence.
Trust me, I'm lying

This is the first time I have posted this joke, and I don't aim to repost anything, but there are also very few jokes that ain't a repost in one form or another

Took me a while but now that I finally understood I am gonna think about it in randomly and laugh. Thanks
The joke is supposed to sound like a seal walks into a nightclub, and you're waiting for a punchline.

What really happened is the seal walked into a billy club, which is what poachers use to kill baby seals (using a gun or a knife would damage the valuable fur, so you use a blunt object instead).

It's the tenant of the flat above me asking to borrow my DVD of their favorite Pixar movie.
It will not be funny if I explain it but I will. Baby seals are killed by poachers using clubs. So saying a seal walks into a club is a way of saying the seal was killed with a club, but it sounds like he just walks into a club. Similar to a person who stabbed someone saying "they walked into the knife" it's technically correct but it's not an accurate representation of the situation.
Must have felt like a kiss from a rose
Explain it to me, I'm dumb

Have YOU read any of the articles released about it. Here is the variety piece that in the very second sentence explains that Elliot Page was once known as Ellen page.

That also but I was talking about [deadnaming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadnaming) as I think that has a stronger negative connotation.
Diarrheas not funny, man - people die from that shit.
As a trans woman myself it's way more than that. It's about people treating you like the person you actually are. When someone deadnames you, even sometimes unintentionally, it can hurt because it can feel like you aren't truly seen as the person you are. For a lot of us being trans isn't some badge of honor or anything, it's just a part of our identity. In my case I am a woman, and work very hard every day so the world will hopefully see me that way, so having people respect that and call me by my name makes me feel fantastic where deadnaming makes me feel like all this effort and fear I go through is for nothing.
it's really similar to the deadname. idk it only took me like a minute to find out
quite sure this is already here somewhere
Do you mean misgender?
That is not how I have understood it at all. Primarily I understand deadnaming to be an often willfull rejection of someone's gender identity and wishes. I have heard some trans people say that these uninvited reminders of their past identity triggers the same kind of painful dysphoria that they experienced when they felt unwelcome in their own gender. While I don't expect that all trans people necessarily have the same visceral reaction, I think it is pretty clear that it is commonly seen as disrespectful and if someone expresses their desire to be addressed under a new name, we can err on the side of caution not to be flippant with the use of their prior identity.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadnaming

https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_58cc58cce4b0e0d348b3434b
Im pretty sure deadnaming was considered a problem because it outed people as transgender who didnt want to be outed. The fact that he is proudly saying that he is trans and being open about it should make deadnaming a non issue right?

I hate the whole "celebrity" bullshit, go live your life, or as Chappelle put it "where is JA!!!!????"
You mean to tell me average people actually give a damn about some celebrity's  personal life.

They can be what ever they want, I just don't need to see every news article breaking it as if it's some earth shattering news, just because they are rich and famous.
This makes more sense to me, I saw the headline pop up on my phone and glanced over it initially. Then the pic popped up and it clicked
/r/iamveryedgy
Have you seen **any** of the articles released about it? The Variety piece that broke the news with his original letter published about the announcement is titled "Oscar Nominated 'Unbrella Academy' Star Elliot Page Announces He Is Transgender"

That's not how this works dude. In the movie Juno, Elliot Page played the part of Juno. I don't know how he feels about dead naming but some find it very offensive. Your original joke wasn't event really that bad in my mind. But take a look at his Wikipedia article for some idea of how to use pronouns and names for trans people.

I think 2020 is the joke of the year.
You don't say "Elliot Page comes out as trans" as no-one would know who that is.  

You say, "Ellen Page comes out as trans and goes by Elliot."
in the movie she is ellen
BREAKING: ELLEN PAGE NOW ELLIOT PAGE!

There has been an increased concern for those affected by intimate violence (IPV) during the pandemic. IPV is another name for domestic violence. It includes sexual violence, physical violence, stalking and emotional abuse from an intimate partner. Anyone, no matter your gender, age, race, or economic status, can experience IPV. It happens when one person in the relationship shows patterns of abusive behavior to gain control over his or her partner.

The pandemic has been a stressful time for most people, and stress is a factor in abusive relationships.

But you still like to poker.  
heh I see what yah did there

Not the right joke but there is definitely one in this
Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the US, is on the one cent (1/100 of $1) coin, also called a penny (I think because of the English "pence").

So he's in a cent (one cent, $0.01).

Unfortunately the dipshit who made this post neglected to make a connection between "innocent"/"in (on) a cent" and literally anything to do with Abraham Lincoln, so it's just a failed, pathetic excuse for a joke.

When ppl say this, its all ab perspective. brainwashed leftists think trump is purely racist and the worst president, and conservatives think he was either pretty good or better than the other option(Im in between pretty good and better than the other option)
If I could Id award this
No, capitalism allows you to have whatever phone your typing on and WiFi to use this app, whatever house you can afford, and whatever nice clothes you have. In communism, you dont have any free money to spend on phones, WiFi, nice shoes, nice clothes, or anything but the necessities

He isn't. It's just going to be slightly less bad than it would be otherwise.
At least he's going out in one final ecstatic crescendo of memery.

Good joke but the framing could use some work. 

For example: 

You should never urinate in the shower, mainly because it'll get you kicked out of Home Depot
You merely adopted the showers. I was born in them.

Let's hope he gets the next promotion he deserves: lifelong prison for the countless laws he broke and couldn't get taken to task for while in office

Damnit... Here.. Take it.. Take my upvote!
Its a nightmare

I understand that "Ouch" is meant to sound like "Ausch", but you still have yet to explain where the "witz" comes from -_-
It's not "Ignorant" to make an offensive joke, it's "Ignorant" to not recognize that it's just a joke, even its offensive...

"Ouch" - "Ausch"... Its wordplay because the words sound similar...

Trust you to read too much into one line... 

You literally just made a mountain out of a mole hill
I understand *why* people do it, but that doesn't make it any less ignorant.

He got promoted to citizen.
Well Gee, I can't imagine why...

It's not like Germany was the birthplace of Nazism or anything...

And before you say it, yes... I know Hitler was Austrian, not German...but Nazism started in Germany
The proclivity for people to associate Germany with Nazism. It's something I've seen repeatedly firsthand over the years.
I wanna have sex at all I love the way it was so sweet I had a great time
Just a question, what ever led you to the conclusion that the joke refers to "Aushwitz"?...

It's a mystery...
It's spelled "wiener", from the city of Vienna (Wien), not "weiner"... and "schnitzel" (no second "n").

At any rate, the joke doesn't make sense. You've given zero explanation for the pun itself.
Oh my days you poor little wienerschnitznel...

It's a joke...and I'm English, I even have a German friend who makes Nazi jokes herself...i banter with her all the time all about it... 

Don't read to much into it
There's no joke here, though. There's no explanation for why a person would say "witz" at the end.

&gt; If you find it find it "Ignorant" you're an idiot...

Well, it's true. Nazism is outright banned in Germany. It is illegal to display Nazi symbols or express pro-Nazi viewpoints in public forums. World War 2 ended almost a century ago. There's no reason to make this association with modern day Germans and the Nazi regime, they are not one and the same.

edit: Also curious why you'd assume someone's an idiot for thinking this is ignorant. Would like a more compelling response to that point.
My God...I mean, "Mein Gott" 

Take the joke...

If you find it find it "Ignorant" you're an idiot...

If you find it offensive in your subjective opinion, then you have that right to think and say so...

I wouldnt say its a terrible "attempt"
Why would you be saying "witz" after "ouch"?

That's not how Auschwitz is pronounced.

Trying to associate modern day Germans with Nazism is a pretty ignorant and offensive take on things. 

All around terrible attempt ngl.

It's a oneliner because it contradicts itself.  You need to use the word "never" to say that the word "never" should never be used.  The showerthought version (which would be a generalization) is: "Never is a word which shouldn't ever be used."

No, watts is energy over time.

So I guess that's like the acceleration of energy usage?  Wattceleration?

Forgive my ignorance, but what is LARPing?
If it was a metaphor would it be similies be
okay so according to urban dictionary's second defimition:

"*be like*

Ghetto slangfor "is like."

Studying for college be like...
(plays a clip ofthe NoodleDance fromPB&amp;JOtter)"


basically what the op meant was "similes is(are) like (the word like being in quotation marks because it is one of the words used for a simile)"

I amn't sure if this makes much sense so I will insert a meme from online of the "be like" template

[here](https://images.app.goo.gl/hZRdZzUWEiqaUKiG6), sorry if it doesn't clarify things, its just a joke off that concept of the first bit
[deleted]
Vacuum cleaner sucks
I... I still don't get it.
in a nutshell the difference between a metaphor and a simile is that a simile uses "like" or "as" as the connecting term, eg "cunning as a fox" being smart whereas a metaphor may be "she is a princess", which may mean she is spoilt or she is beautiful etc

in a nutshell, the simile is just a metaphor with those specific words, however the joke doesn't conform to be a simile it just makes the oneliner element that they use the term "like"

hope this helped at all

This is actually witty as fuck. Maybe more than a dad joke.

Good, but works best verbally. Written down, there is confusion because it should be under rated (two words) or under-rated. By the time that's been worked out, the humour dissipates.
You know how people always complain that they thought of something really witty after the moment was gone, or the person walked away?

The word right below "rated", according to a dictionary, is "rat" (not rats, as plurals are usually grouped in part of the singular noun.
Hence, NOT proved.
Technically, "rats" would not have its own definition as it is the plural form of "rat". Therefore, rats are overrated.
A good pun is its own reword.
That figure is a little too low

He was holding his endorsement from everybody for a while because he didn't want to sway other people's endorsements/votes because he knows he has a lot of power being the previous president. The fact that he didn't give it specifically for Biden immediately doesn't mean anything.

Edit: you're the first person I've ever seen who has negative Karma on their account.
Doesnt actually mean hes actually voting for trump though
Vice president who the ex president didn't even endorse at first lmaoo
You're talking about someone who is literally the last vice president versus somebody who has destroyed our country over the last 4 years and let over 200,000 Americans died through negligence and lies. I'm pretty sure there is one qualified candidate.
Take some pictures.
Whats he doing?
I'm definitely voting  1+ for this.

Nice keep training then you can get a job at FedEx.  They appreciate people who already know how to kick box.
It's rather common in sports circles.
I think Booger Mcfarland once said this line. I've heard it several times in various forms around sports.

"Stats are like Bikinis, they show some things, but they don't show *all things*"
Wrong;  Alcohol is a solvent.  It only becomes a solution once you allow your problems dissolve into it.
My girlfriend spent months leatning to kick box, and then she learned that was a foul. You can only kick above the belt.

How hard was that? It still doesn't fit in this sub because it's clearly two lines shoved into one, but it's at least some semblance of what you're supposed to post here.

A one liner would be like:

&gt; Only Comcast employees get their Comcast internet fixed.

Now we see where the joke itself breaks down as not really being that funny, but that's okay. We can't win 'em all. I applaud any effort that at least tries to fit the bill.

If you refuse to make even the slightest concession to other people's comfort, even if it costs you but the smallest bit of effort, then that is very much selfish and a terribly petty hill to die on. No amount of hiding behind opinions will change the facts. Neither the fact that such blatant indifference to other people's discomfort is shitty, nor the fact that mental identity is independent from physical reality. 

Being unwilling to allow your mind to be changed by such facts is just the poop-cherry on the shit-cake. I hope you receive the same respect from others that you are willing to show them.
Htcib
You wont change my mind, but thanks for the insight.

Is it selfish to call people what you think it is? Probably, but I care more about myself than I care about anyone else. You might think of this as "negative", I just think of it as an opinion not everyone agrees with. Again, thanks for the insight, I guess I will refer to it as "sex" instead of "gender", though in my mind they are one and the same.
You are one in a melon! ;)
&gt;If this sounds condescending, I didn't mean it to be, it just takes a little more effort to type it in a non-condescending way than it does to write this.

Then I'll attempt to explain what I boeve your misconception to be in good faith.

&gt;Agender? Bigender?
&gt;
&gt;Yeah sounds like something out of science fiction. I've heard of Hermaphrodites, (is that how you spell it?) and it's the only other "gender" that I consider real. 3 genders, Male, Female or Hermaphrodite. All my personal opinion though, so take it how you want to.

Do you mean sex, as in, what organs and bits you have? Sex in humans typically ranges from male, over intersex, to female. That would be the three I believe you are referring to. They are strictly connected to the physical bits, and what exactly anyone's physical bits are does not really concern anyone but themselves and potential sexual partners.

Gender is not sex. It is an aspect of identity, typically concerned with such things as how you wish to be addressed and referred to. In western cultures, it is typically assigned at birth based on the physical bits of the baby. That's where terms such as AMAB (Assigned Male at Birth = I was born with a dick, generally) and AGAB (Guess this one) come from. 

But not everyone is comfortable with what they were assigned at birth, and while many of them identify as the binary opposite, there others who feel that neither of the two (exclusively) matches who they are.

Given your take on gender, I'm  assuming you fall into the binary. Are you a guy? Imagine me constantly calling you a girl, and referring to you as she. If it happens once, you correct me. If it happens all the time, you'd likely start to get irritated and uncomfortable. 

This is why in many LGBT+ friendly circles you'll see people listing their pronouns, to clarify how they'd like you to refer to them when talking about them. The binary are easy to understand, but the non-binary ones can become a little tricky, because you actually have to divorce your concept of gender from associating it strictly with the physical equipment. 

Agender people for instance typically don't feel comfortable being called either man or woman. To them, being called either of the two feels like being called the opposite feels to most cisgender people (people whose sense of identity lines up with the gender they were assigned at birth, and typically with their sex). They may elect to be referred to with gender-non-specific pronouns (they), or as a neutral grammatical gender (it), or even make up their own pronouns (Neopronouns = new made up pronouns that they feel comfortable with). They may also elect to continue to be addressed with traditional binary pronouns; There is no hard  and fast rule.

Bigender people may feel comfortable with more than one such identity. For some it's a fluid thing, where their preferred way of being addressed/referred to may change from time to time. Others may feel permanently comfortable with, for example, being considered both woman and man - they won't feel any less comfortable if you address them as either.

Transgender is an umbrella term describing anyone whose sense if identity doesn't line up with what they were assigned at birth.

There is another whole discussion to be had about presenting as one thing or the other, and a lot of sensitive debate is being had on the topic of passing as one thing or another. Neither of these are strictly part of your identity, but they are often connected to it. 

The bottom line is that you don't need to understand and sympathise with it all, but I ask that you please respect how people would like to be called and referred to, simply because that is human decency. If people have their pronouns listed, it takes little effort to try and use them. 

Tl;Dr: Gender is not sex, it is an aspect of identity, is not limited to biological limits, can be as diverse as human psychological and respecting people's wishes on how to address them really isn't hard.

What the fuck did I just watch
Which is both stupid and insensitive. Finding terms to describe how you feel is no more making up of things than all of human speech is. And implying that people's feelings are invalid, because they're made up, can be pretty hurtful to people who just don't feel comfortable with either of the binary terms and premade identities. 

Various cultures have long recognised more than the two genders typically assigned based on sex, and intersex people are a thing too. It's just the modern western mindset that dictates there are only two genders.
Teething
Theyre implying as well as making up (form a part of) a proportion of the population they also make up (fabricate) their gender.
What's the joke?

Of course, of course.
Observing the natural world, including women.
According to a [survey I found checking Wikipedia's references](https://fondationjasminroy.com/en/initiative/lgbt-realities-survey/), only 5% of the LGBT+ community surveyed identify as non-binary in any way. Since the LGBT+ community itself is a subset of the total community, and assuming the survey is representative of at least the LGBT+ community, it stands to reason that at least 95% of the population are binary (i.e. male or female), whether cis or trans. As such, there are more men and women (95%) than people of genders other than male or female (the non-binary 5%).

&gt;They make up a lot more than proportions.

I'm not sure what point you're trying to make, since even a subset of 90% would be a proportion, as in 9:10 (nine out of ten) being a proportion. And non-binary people are most assuredly a much smaller set. 

It may seem like we're a lot more common if you're active in subs where we're better represented, but that's a skewed demographic. If you're looking at the beach, you're going to find a lot more sea-shells than in the mountains.

Congrats, you showed how lame you are to everyone over here
Agender, Bigender, Demigender, there are a lot of non-binary genders. They're by far the minority, so the joke holds because they make up a smaller proportion than the traditional binary.

YES, and its not just like a shower thought one liner, if you get what I mean
Youre welcome! Its quite popular here in the UK hence why I can talk about it
The homonym of grannys myth and Granny Smith adds good wordplay
This a really good one liner, I dont know why its just really good. It wasnt one of the cant stop laughing jokes its just the perfect laugh for the content of the joke.
Ooh, never heard of them, it is a good one then. Thanks for the explanation.
Theres a type of Apple called Granny smiths. Its a play on words
Am I stupid and missing the joke or is it a bad one and doesn't make sense?

Can we stop shoving jokes into this sub through the use of commas and semicolons.

It's not "one line" if there's a pause in the statement or it's not an English sentence anymore.
Sorry to go off topic but I have short term memory problems
Saw Scott Manley talk about this in a video a couple of days ago and I am proud I got it!
Those are commas, still one sentence, so definitely not a three-liner.
They'll always be stumped during a quiz too

It's not a sentence if there's a comma splice.
Which song from the album?  I suggest Comfortably Dumb?  

*dran autocorrect.
Even if he worked there, they'd still be shorthanded.
should be two sentences
You're my kind of sick.
A one liner is all punchline, so "I think I have hypochondria" works because the joke is you think you have said condition in which you would think you have a condition.
I think I have hypochondria definitely wouldnt work on its own as a joke. The crowd would be waiting for a punchline.
If you know the what hypochondria is it works pretty damn well
Can confirm; I read about it online.
Time travel complicates grammar.

Because it doesnt work without the second line.
Yet we're still upvoting it just because.
Thank you fine sir/madam. OP just tried too hard to smush a mediocre joke in to a very poorly worded single sentence.
Grammatical sense*
Well what about it doesn't make sense? I could explain myself.
That makes almost no sense
Those are commas. Still 1 sentence.

This joke is rather coarse
I thought about it and posted there. It was taken down because it was a "personal" thought or something like that. I think the mod thought I was throwing shade at TED talks and didn't want any part of it
It could and it was
This could have been posted as a Shower Thought.

Isn't it weird how read rhymes with lead, but read also rhymes with lead.
This might get a bit confusing

The words 'read'(reed) and 'lead'(leed) rhyme, and the words 'read'(red) and 'lead'(led) rhyme but the words 'read'(reed) and 'lead'(led) dont rhyme

I love that read can be read as reed (the plant) or red (the colour) and our brains have to think about the previous conversation and figure out if someone is reading something, has already read it, is talking about the water plant, or just loves talking about the colour red.
This, this entire thread!!!!    &lt;3

I dont get it.

Lol, you are ignorant and, well, stupid. Joe Biden is widely documented as a pedophile, it is literally all over YouTube, these videos of racist failure joe biden sniffing little girls. You can hate Trump, fine, but Biden is disgusting and indefensible.
Yoga is shadowy kama sutra
Joe Biden, "I'll take Trump behind the shed and beat his ass"....IRL, Trump wasted Biden
Evertime Trump started kicking Chris Wallace's ass, Chris wallace would say, "wel, let's move on". Trump thrashed both of them. Cfris Walllace: "I'm the moderator here". Trump: "I'm the president, and I'm annihilating you, and this brain dead pussy coward Joe Biden".
Interrupt the moderator? Every time Trump put Biden on the ropes, Chris Wallace jumped on to save Biden.  Chris Wallace did almost nothing but run interfere for Biden all night. After 3.5 years of Biden talking shit about Trump, when they finally met up, Trump kicked his ass....as well as his bullshit body guard.
Ok this one made me laugh 
wait a minute..
Does this apply to gymnasts too?
Trump Tests Positive for the Coronavirus
I've seen the PornHub videos. I don't think it has much to do with yoga.
Yup, biden sounds like bye then
[removed]
Bet thats the first time youve said that
Cause hes a pedo too, gotta look out for others. He tried to flame biden for his sons cocaine addiction cause he got caught. Trumps son hasnt gotten caught yet so he can call him out, but trump is a pedo and hasnt been arrested for it yet so its okay
So interrupting the moderator and his opponent, as well as only lying and using ad hominem to your opponent is kicking their asses... hmm TIL 
It is thoroughly sickening
*Why didnt Trump bring*

*Up that bye den is a hair*

*Sniffing pedophile?*

So...someone downvoted my "I don't get it" instead of explaining it. I assume strongly it was a Trump-sheep, because only them are insanely aggressive. The funny thing is: I got it now. Biden = by then? Like all of them said Biden to their brain when they listen to Trump?

Yeah, I think in certain positions, your behavior should match what you are supposed to represent.



Which is why I still dont really get why so many "hard" christians support him, the dude breaks most rules the bible sets constantly :)
Someone got a bad deal. He certainly fucked the country more.
He paid $5.2m income tax 2016, 2017. Boring correction sorry.
Who says he hasn't?
So taxes gone wild eh?
That's correct! That's why the subscribe to U.S.-based politics subs!
Its one line and it seems like a joke
Well beyond that, if there was any organic matter left of him.
The fact that its such a bizarre yet true fact makes it a joke in and of itself though
Why tf is posted in this sub?
True, and additionally, dont get me wrong, I hate Trump, but Bill Clinton did it in the Oval Office. With one of his interns. Being held accountable for your behavior on the job is part of having a job. Is it my bosss business if I fuck? No. Is it my bosss business if I fuck AT WORK? See, thats when it becomes a concern.
U.S. politics affect people from other places too. Plenty of people around the world are following our situation.
Man I really hope he doesnt
Ever?
What's funny is that if it did turn political and people started airing out leftist fuckery, they'd get mad and quarantine this sub 
nice comma splice ya got there.
yeah this belongs in r/showerthought
If you count the taxes paid by his various plaintiffs and the people who are low-key blackmailing him he actually probably pays a decent chunk of Russian money to us.
Depends I think... If they pretend to be all christian and shit we should be in our right to call them out for acting like that.
Very true. It's a good thing he doesn't appoint family members for sex like he appointed family members to cushie lucrative government positions.
To be fair the government has fucked him more times than stormy tho
That's cool. Guess what, not this entire sub is from the U.S.

....and some of Stormy Daniels' trims are tax deductible.
Yea after I said fragment it was wrong. Quip is a good description there tho
Its actually just a punctuation error. Anyway, I found it funny though I know humors subjective and I agree its more of a quip than a joke.
Yeah, now try to come up with something original yourself. Not that easy, I see.

Passing literal newspaper headlines as one liners, smh
Ha! What a boob.
Not true
Based on the numbers being quoted hes paid more money to the Russian Government than to the US Government.
If you just looked at Google real quick you'd see that the only money trump has paid is 44,000 dollars to reimburse Daniels for legal fees. Meanwhile, Daniels was ordered to pay 300,000 dollars.... doesn't really fit the anti trump narrative tho
Huh? This is a factual observation that happens to be one sentence, not one-line joke.
"A variety of funny one-lined jokes." Isn't a joke, isn't funny, and it's a fragment if we're going grammar nazi mode.
That is a one liner
And if Daniels had honored the NDA you wouldn't know this.
I said it about Bill Clinton and I'll say it about Donald Trump... What the presidents do with their genitals is their own business.
Not a one liner please for the love of fuck dont make this sub about politics too

Jokes on you, that other idiot was also billed $300 and paid in full
Its funny because its true
Stormy Daniels was the only qualified person he hired
Orng men bed LoL xD
Lol! Thats funny!
Yes, I know. it was tough to make this fit as one line.
Unless I'm missing something, I'm pretty sure this isn't a joke.

Slaughter IS the best medicine
Because state medical boards are independent and self-governing.
how could you lose your license for performing a completely legal medical surgery?
But state medical boards are self-governing. Thered be a risk of losing your license regardless of what the law is.
not in the 12 states where female circumcision is fully legal.
Thats correct. Its no longer illegal at the federal level either as of 2018. A doctor would run the risk of losing his or her license in any state, however.
female circumcision is legal in 12 US states.

Ahh. Were comparing apples and oranges. Im on the grammar side and youre on the joke technique side. To each their own...
That still doesn't make it a oneliner. It's still setup and punchline, whether you put a full stop, a semi-colon, a comma, or nothing in between.

Ok, fine. Have it your way. Just say it as a run on it if suits you.

How are they against any body modification when they (in certain areas) forcibly cut off part of their childrens penises
Only Christians who don't know much are against them.
If youre a Christian, youre not supposed to be calling other Christians idiots.


Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you. - Ephesians 4:32
TBF there is some scriptural support in Leviticus 19:28 depending on how a given sect interprets the current validity of those Old Testament laws
&gt;If all body piercing is sinful, as some say, then even a diamond stud in a girls ear lobe is taboo. Such a stance goes too far, considering that earrings (and even nose rings) were accessories for Hebrew women: in an extended metaphor, God reminds Jerusalem of the lavish blessings He had bestowed on the people: I put a ring on your nose, earrings on your ears (Ezekiel 16:12). Its unlikely that God would have used earrings (and nose rings) as a symbol of beauty and blessing if such jewelry were inherently sinful. See also Song of Solomon 1:1011.

I've been vegan for a while now and I'm not sure what you're referring to? People season meat with herbs, salt, spices and a multitude of other plants, not the other way around?
North Korean*. I take offense to that as a Southie.
That's true, but the OP made me think more of people preparing meals in their own homes. When I cook vegetables, I don't try to make them taste like meat.
Can you show us? Im not vegan but at least I can acknowledge their fight.
isnt a line a length?
I see what you did there
Just replace the . with 'because'
Yep, good idea.  Well, I'm going to go kill myself now.
Just because we dont want animals to suffer for our food doesnt mean we dont like or miss the taste of meat- it is also a good means of advocating for others to eat less meat now that there are so many meat free options
Beefroot
Those vegetables already taste like meat
Unless you're Korean, then he's in front of you.
I see what you did there
*Laxed out loud*
&gt;Nestl 

&gt;their hearts.

Yeah no, there's a fundamental problem right there.
How would they know what meat tastes like?
I assure you that even if it's good for the environment, it is about money. It's not like huge companies like Nestl and the likes sell vegetarian alternatives out of the kindness of their hearts.
It is.
Meats have a lot of umami - one of the basic tastes our tongues recognize, along with sweet, sour, salty, and bitter (and [possibly fat](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-we-taste-fat/)). But you can get umami from many veg sources - tomatoes, mushrooms, some seaweeds, walnuts &amp; almonds, and aged cheeses (parmesan, blue cheeses, etc.), and many other fermented foods - miso (and soy sauce and other soy products), sauerkraut, kimchi, nutritional yeast, and yeast extracts (such as Marmite). There's even some in potatoes and corn which may help account for their popularity.

Realizing you can add umami with condiments is huge. (And if you're a meat-eater you can add fish and oyster sauce, worcestershire sauce and others to the condiments mentioned above.)
still would be a two liner

its awkward as hell to say as a one liner
Suuuure buddy, evidence is *definitely* in your favor.
Yes, except it's not about money but about making an effort to reduce the amount of meat sold by whatever margin possible, thus reducing animal suffering and environmental strain caused by forcing methane-producing animals to breed. Or at least, it should be. There are companies out there more concerned about finding market niches to capitalize on.
I'd rather my veggies taste like veggies, thanks. 

But the idea is to try and trick meat-eaters into accidentally having a more planet- and animal-friendly diet.
You are wrong in every way, but yeah, why rant on a joke sub.
I love meat. I love one liners. I love aspiring writers and comedians. This post has two of the three pillars of an excellent one liner. No joke here, folks. Just want to support the community.
The hardest part about eating a vegetable is the wheelchair.
Nice.
r/lostredditors
Ahaha lmao good stuff
Another neighborhood vegetarian, and I actually am not about how some food companies are working to make vegetarian food to taste like meat. Like I get it, some people want that. But not all of us do. The impossible burger is a great new thing, but restaurants are getting rid of their veggie or black bean burgers because of it. Like nah bruh, keep that veggie patty option for the vegetarians that dont like the meat taste!
This is more just an interesting question than a joke. Most of us like meaty, savory flavors. I just don't want an animal to have to die for it, and I'm not willing to support an industry that's so bad for the world in every imaginable way. It's also just bad for you compared to plants that taste like meat. Wow, I'm ranting on r/oneliners. Whoops.
To get more people like you to eat more vegetarian food. If the items are more appealing to meat eating humans they will sell more, thus earning more money.

Or call them beetroot beef and vegan tuna. Call it beetroot
That is multiple small lines, don't lie man
Good point
Good one, but it belongs in r/jokes.
What? I am just pointing out the fact that your post didn't follow the rules. For mobile user like me, this sub is enjoyable because you don't need to open a thread to read all the jokes in a page. You breaking the rules force people to tap open your post which is annoying.
You know the story.. Drunk and singing songs from my younger days 
Haha
Yeah if only OP used a comma instead of that full stop
I woke up sober and got carried away... 
Lol
Huh? And an ellipses is "..." not ..... ...
Maybe just **hard rock** should boulder....
...and Heavy Metal, be Iron maiden?
Stephen Wright Joke
That was the most cleaver thing I've read on this entire sub
That's a pretty entitled thing to say
First rule of the sub

&gt; Entire joke should be in the title.
One line in two parts
  I had another one of those dreams about you last night You did some things to me youve never done before
It ain't a crime if you don't get caught,,, it aint a sale if it dont get bought ... Sorry about the H.O.P Lyrics
Stop trying to correct small grammatical oddities lmao. An ellipses is correct. An ellipses is dot dot dot. 

An ellipse is a 2-dimensional circular shape that is dilated uniformly in one dimension, and dilated by a different factor in the other dimension. Think of inserting a circle in microsoft word and squashing/squeezing it by one of the edges (not the corners).
Arrrr
An ellipse
r/twoliners
Nothing is changed if an ellipses is used as opposed to a comma; just thought the comma would be easier to understand and synthesise into real life knowledge. 

By the way, the reason that the ellipses doesnt change anything is because its read the same with an ellipses as it is with a comma.
Well you put a comma in between "pirate" and "as", op did not
savage
No its not lmao. Never take the P out of  pirate, as he becomes incredibly angry is not a run on sentence. Its an independent clause conjoined to a dependant clause by both a comma and contrast conjunction (as). It is the poster child of a compound sentence and doesnt run on at all.
r/thatsthejoke
Its a run on
r/twoliners?
Its a single sentence
Noice.
Oh cool I like the letter ocean as well

I dont get it. This joke has me stumped.
You actually don't have to train them -they just do that.

Nobody's figured out how.
You can do better. This joke has poor footing.
Don't you hate it when someone posts two lines in a one liner sub, I do.
Its called a repost
You sound mad, go let off some steam
Homing joke.
oh ok
A homing pigeon is a bird that has been trained to return to its owner, so the joke assumes that the bird flies back to its owner every time after it is sold
Me neither.

How do people keep coming up with this joke? I've seen it like 5 times over the past few months.
Depends.
Very well.
are you that dumb or just kidding?
"I sold my homing pigeon 8 times last month"

Fixed it!
Yeah, its tough to manage my two sides, its actually a problem when i'm trying to write a stand up set haha
Thats a two-liner.

Why? Most people consider me an angle in disguise.
180 cannot be called a complete turn, as it's only half way. Only 360 is a complete turn. 

You are correct that your view is completely opposite, but the turn is not complete. 

Should read: 'but then I did a 180'. 180 is of course a straight angle. :-)
But a 180 turn is a complete opposite in point of view, while a 360 turn is ending at your original point of view.
180 is only halfway, 360 is a complete turn.
You need to integrate with the rest of us more discretely.
No, I think it's cos my problems keep multiplying.
That's because you probably associate with base premises.

Ironic that this oneliner is stolen from someone else without giving credit or payment.  Whereas Edison did not steal from Tesla, he paid him as an employee to invent things for Edison's company.

Good one...got my upvote
Also if tesla was left alone we would have never seen his inventions. He wasn't good at nor cared about marketing his inventions. Which is a good lesson. In a capitalist society. No matter how good your invention is, if you can't bring it to market it might aswel never existed at all.

Fun fact, even though Elon Musk named his car company Tesla. He looks up to Edison more because of his marketing skills. He named the car company "Tesla" because the cars use the DC motor Tesla invented. I got all of this from a interview I watched that featured Elon Musk
I taught a (high school) class once that only had 12 students in it.  It was a fairly large classroom, and the students insisted on sitting all the way in the back - it was a struggle to get them to move up front.  One day I  tank against the back wall and told them it was the new class pet tarantula.  It had decorations and substrate in it, but there was actually no spider.  From that day on, every one of them sat as close to the front of the room as possible.

Too bad that Edison did invent the lightbulb.  Patents show thats accurate.  The lightbulb improvement came out several years later based again on the patent date.
It's an old joke but I still like it and fuck Edison

condom n.
1. The protective plastic bag that accompanies 3.5-inch microfloppy diskettes. Rarely, also used of (paper) disk envelopes. Unlike the write protect tab, the condom (when left on) not only impedes the practice of SEX but has also been shown to have a high failure rate as drive mechanisms attempt to access the disk -- and can even fatally frustrate insertion. 2. The protective cladding on a light pipe. 3. `keyboard condom': A flexible, transparent plastic cover for a keyboard, designed to provide some protection against dust and programming fluid without impeding typing. 4. `elephant condom': the plastic shipping bags used inside cardboard boxes to protect hardware in transit. 5. n. obs. A dummy directory /usr/tmp/sh, created to foil the Great Worm by exploiting a portability bug in one of its parts. So named in the title of a comp.risks article by Gene Spafford during the Worm crisis, and again in the text of "The Internet Worm Program: An Analysis", Purdue Technical Report CSD-TR- 823.

Indeed, clever political one-liners are few and far between, so this was appreciated.
Yeah. I thought it could be interpreted as the circle of political stance (as you described), or by others that the left is right=correct. I just kept hearing "radical left" at the RNC and thought there was a play on words that stays open for interpretation, which makes a good one-liner IMO.
Haha, I get it.

You're referring to the popular political idea of "Horseshoe Theory," which stipulates that the political far left and political far right are closer to each other than we often believe, and that instead of being on opposite ends of a line they're close to one another on the ends of a horseshoe- or in some cases, a circle.

Im here 156 days later. Insomnia sucks, but this sub (and thread) is a great discovery. Had to scroll to figure out the joke, too. :)
TIL the difference between acronyms and initialisms. Thanks!
Thank you
What does pain have to do with French?  I am thick sometimes.
The *real* wtf is always in the comments
I'd actually buy one of the 5 or so original Chevy grand sport corvettes, or a Ford GT... Definitely something American.
This shits awesome. I'll take it onto *account*, get it... It's a pun!
*This a statement, there's*

*Not even like a pun to*

*It or anything*

No WTF is an initialism
This is way more than one line and has scam written all over it.
Technically two lines. A punctuation before the punchline breaks it up so it's not a oneliner imo.
Same
Thats great.
I just checked their posts and doesnt look like any doubles there. All seem pretty original and consistent.
Why do you keep reposting the same jokes everyday?
Lmfao made me laugh at least 
Fuck if I know
Thats a tough one. I cunt finger it out.
Reminds me of another one, 

My wife told me to stop being immature, so I told her to get out of my fort
You changed the game .
Too late!
This joke is quality.
Take your updoot and get out.
Also...not a oneliner.
Should I be the party pooper and point out that a lot of moths *are* out during the daytime?
This is a little short of humerus
This one confused me at first but then I remembered Smarties are different in the UK than the US

You Pad-ded this joke out.
Never heard them called soldier ants, just army ants.
In some places bars are closed and everyone is drinking at home.  So, if they don't open the bars soon, everyone will be an alcoholic.
You mean after jumping out of the plane, but it would also be true if you never left the ground.

Hmmm, I don't think that lines up. Lines vary in many ways. Yes they are both lines but no, they are not the same lines.
You didnt search very well.  Heres one example:

https://www.reddit.com/r/oneliners/comments/f4t1kt/_/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

There are many others depending on the length of the line.
Fabulous.
Is it though? I searched the sub's timeline before posting
The bottom line is that this is a repost.
Yeah but not a very well told one. Calm down.
Oh yes, a trilogy is mandatory. I gotta say things get a bit crooked in the third installment, /
Okay, fair point. He is MUCH taller in the summer. You are looking far too deeply into it, BUT if you take into account the bodies cooking system, then 6 inches is legitimate.
You can have my upvote but I expect, at least, a trilogy and a cohesive timeline
Motherfff
Well, okay. But its still weirdly specific for np reason.
You can get away with the joke being 2 lines because it's hilarious! 
6 inches is 15.24 cm
Ah. Weirdly specific to say 6 inches then.

 I didn't notice that. Now it's funnier. I hope that doesn't draw the typical douchecanoe that harps about r/twoliners
It's so good they put it in the sub logo
This is my facial expression when Im in a state of Cloud Nine...
That's funny. It's not. I just gave you the definitions. If you'd like to verify what a one-liner is based on the sub's rules though...you'd still be wrong.

How about the rest of the family?
why short-lived? wouldnt he want more coitus
Two silk worms had a race which ended in a tie.
Is this some kind of plot?
Italian
No.
yes that's perfect
A one liner is, by definition, one line
I trust you weren't looking for a one-night stand.
It's almost as if people in this sub don't actually know what a one-liner is. Let's see..  A short joke or witty remark. A perfectly timed, short, witty remark. A very succinct joke or witticism. A succinct or meaningful and especially accurate statement. A brief joke or amusing remark. That's odd, I surely expected to see something here about one-liners needing to literally transcribe a single line of text to qualify as a one-liner. Complain all day but sentences with proper punctuation still qualify. However, OP shouldn't used a semicolon.
[deleted]
Oh shit. This is brilliant.

Adding more commas dont make it a oneliner

The Republican snowflake paradox. No human is more sensitive than a staunch republican, yet they project their baby tears unto others.
You occasionally see studies on exactly this in r/science. This joke is just another conservative whining.
Like I know it's a joke and all but as someone who doesn't claim to be any political party, I've honestly seen more conservatives act like whiny babies wayyyyy more than liberals have, especially in the last presidential term.
Won't lie. Took me a moment to think about it.

I like the word 'frequency', I try to use it at regular intervals.
Well personally I frequently tend to talk about the word frequently. It's a very frequent thing and people often comment on how frequently I use the word frequently.

get it I do not
Ive read it like 10 times but still dont get it, someone enlighten me please
Ok.
You need a comma in there
Yeah I think I saw her too. She seemed pretty down so I told her to just put her best foot forward.

*Undersized mountains are hill areas.*
Does this mean we've made a mountain out of a molehill?
Just glad he made my day
Even more ironic that the one-liner in this joke is in the second line.
Stand your ground.
This right here, is the peak of comedy.
it isn't op's joke, but I guess he did a good job at typing in the words and tapping/clicking on the "post" button
Mountain ranges aren't funny, they're hill areas.
Well done 
One would have to know what an "After 8" is...

Come up with something better than just lazy misogyny
What do you say to a woman with two black eyes?


Nothing, she's already been told twice.
Or as Simon Whistler says, BA DA DUM DUM TSSSSSSSSSSSSSH
That I want it that way!
What do you call posting a 2 line joke in r/one liners?    
A near miss
You could comfortably say it in one line, even if it's two sentences. The point of a oneliner is that there is no pause between setup and punchline, so there is no time to anticipate it.

It becomes a two liner if you split up the two parts with a pause.

&gt;The worst pub I've ever been to was "The Fiddle", what a vile inn.

Alternatively you could say "quite the vile inn", but the point is that you say it in one go. The alternative would be with some sort of pause between, like the OP indicates, or some filler words:

&gt;The worst pub I've ever been to was "The Fiddle". I have never before seen such a vile inn.
A semicolon would fix that.

This is already a two-liner.
The stay caused a lot of treble
But that would make it a two liner wouldn't it?
Aint nothing but a mistake
I tried that, and it was auto-rejected. My guess is that it's more of a pun, and apparently those aren't Shower Thoughts material.
Tell me whyyy
All the periods distract from the joke. To all of you who are planning to repost this joke, use just one period in the middle when you repost it.
That's ba-a-a-ad
Dont ever let anyone tell you what to do.
&gt;My father taught me never to explain myself, but didn't tell me why.

That's more like one line.

The thing that people need to keep in mind, is that in writing, there's a lot of low hanging fruit that's obvious to everyone. You can come to the same conclusion and punchline as millions of other people completely on your own. 

It's why every cashier dreads an item not scanning correctly, cause they know the customer is gonna say, "So that means its free, right? hehehehehehe"
Being here everyday makes it more annoying. Meaning seeing reposts constantly.

Oh okay. I thought it may have been a gay guy enjoying the idea of being locked up with other men.
Sounded funnier in my head I guess. Its a play on the if ____ is illegal, then lock me up! phrase, implying that the speaker is guilty of the blank. Like, if someone said if eating pillows is illegal, then lock me up, then they eat pillows. So in the joke, illegal is switched with gay, so the person is saying that if being progressive (which he is implied to be) makes him gay, then he should be locked up. This also implies that they (a hypothetical person) believe that gays should be locked up, a contradiction.
Cant wait for this to be added to Hot Posts

The last sentence is the key. This is the case for Android as well. Apple's only advantage is in that they minimize the number of combinations their devices are subjected to; so automatically the chances of things going wrong is way lower, and they have more control over what they deliver.

P.S. I've loved the stability of Windows since W7 and haven't had major issues. Probably Windows doesn't agree with your device and app combination.
Compared to MacOS, its horrible. My laptops crashed after waking up from sleep or if I try and open too many apps immediately after i turn it on. My friends macbook has none of those issues. 

I guess thats the price you pay when the os needs to be optimised for so many devices.

Hey
Funny that I came upon this because I was just saying to my friend that the government should step in and put an end to the health insurance "bending us over the barrel."  The biweekly "chunk" out of my check was absurd, the crazy high deductibles were a sick joke, and then a "co-pay" just because they can, it's out of control.

This one is good
I didnt laugh, I didnt even roll my eyes. It absolutely didnt phase me. 

But you saying you laughed out loud made me feel fantastic on the inside. So its worth it.
What's the difference between a joke and a rhetorical question?

Same as the way u heard.
That was the joke
This one.
How did u hear it?
This joke is always gold. 

I was on Discord with some friends and someone jumped on and started a story. Seconds into the story he disconnected. We just sat there for a minute waiting on him to finish the story and of course, nothing. I said "What's the worse thing about cliffhangers?" Everyone else kept asking "What?" so I stayed silent. Took them a few but they got the punchline
What do you get if you cross a joke with a rhetorical question?
Ah fuck me I didn't get the joke.

I feel like this is just a setup and punchline, but you added commas to keep it a "one"-liner.

Yes, i agree. More of a visual joke as well
I read that as "See the teacher and pound it out".
Youre the human equivalent of a squashed milk carton. Scram
You are no fun. Get lost.
Well I couldnt, cause I was somehow indebted to her:
During the whole exam, I was suggesting answers to a friend of mine. She caught us and threw us both out. My friend felt really bad, because he knew how much it meant to me, so he begged the teacher to let me in again, and she did. 
The next morning I overslept and she saw that as a sign of disrespect, and so lowered a bit my grade, which is fair enough.
Bruh lmao I wouldve been heated maaan
Shit hash or pound still sounds funny to me lol 
Ah I see... thanks!
it's [hash](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hash%20out). had to google it. not a native speaker. nice joke.
Real story:

I did "Introduction to programming in C" in the first year of university.

In the test I scored full points, but as a punishment for not showing up the next day to take my grade, the teacher marked it as 9++ (we use grades from 4 to 10).

Oh ok, thanks, but, sorry if I ruin the joke, do people actually say "he'll face time" when referring to facing time in jail? Or was it just a stretch for the joke? Sounds kinda weird to me, but English isn't my first language sooo...
They could face time in jail, also facetime is apple's video calling app
Me too
Me dumb, pleas explain
This is also good work here. Keep rolling em, homie
No. Diseases can be caused by infections. All STDs are caused by STIs. Its common these days to use STI instead of STD because of the stigma around the term STD. 

Also not all diseases stay for life. Bacterial STDs such as gonorrhea and syphilis are curable with antibiotics. 

Viral STDs like herpes, HIV, and warts are treatable but not curable.
What does this even mean?
Your version makes less sense, because it suggests that both hiding in a drain and scaring his wife are somehow aspects of dressing like a clown. She's asking him to do the other stuff while dressed like a clown.

&gt;Last night my wife asked me if I wanted to dress up as a clown, hide in the drains, and scare her, but I didn't really feel like It.

It made sense the way it was originally written, but maybe an extra comma (as above) would help? Grammar is tricky, esp if English isn't your first language.

What's even more funny is the comment section...
~~Coulrophobia~~ Oh, never mind. "Clown phobia" is good enough.
Yeah I get that this is about it but I didn't find it that funny. It's like where's the joke? It's like a joke except the punchline is missing.
Haven't seen the new ones and haven't see the old one in ages but isn't the character Pennywise?

To those saying it's not funny, what?! 

I lol'd every time the clown popped up in that movie.   I suppose it's only not funny to people with the clown phobia (forgot the term)
That was a good example
"One day I saw a transvestite wearing women's clothing, and I thought to myself, 'ah, those must be his transves-tights'"

(tights are UK slang for panty hose)
Give me an example
I've heard worse!
But it wasn't funny, was it?
It is, they're saying they didn't feel like the Character 'It', from the film 'It'
They're always funnier if you have to explain them first!
There may be other word for this thing, because it isn't a joke
Yeah cause explaining the punchline before even saying the joke is what makes the joke so great
Oh..OH
Whut
Lol
They capitalized It at the end referring to the movies/book.
What
This might have been a dud.
Ah ok, so it should have been two sentences, i get it now.
OP describes the character in the movie in the movie IT who is referred to as "it". That dualism of the character's name and sentence structure makes it funny. Although now that I've explained, probably not so much.
"It" is not a funny movie. "It" is a scary movie. 


Jokes aside, theres a double meaning on the last word in the joke. "It" could refer to the movie or the thing he was talking about.
I didn't really feel like "It"

U know the scary clown movie w balloon
Am i not understanding because of bad grammar and because it isn't really that funny?

Am i understanding this as the same joke?

Last night my wife asked me if I wanted to dress up as a clown. She wanted me to hide in the drains and scare her, but I didn't really feel like It.
It's the joke
Yea but what's the joke
The movie It
This is about the movie it
2nd degree, perhaps?
explain?
This is probably true, tbh
Take out the "though" and that's the one

Grow up.
Happens all the time. Either its the police or some local youths.
The practical rule of thumb, I'd say, is you should be able to tell a one-liner without even the hint of a pause. The debates here get hung up on how jokes are delivered in text, when the real joy in jokes -- especially one-liners -- is how you say them aloud. It gets back to their borscht belt roots, which relied on voice and pace. (This wouldn't apply to one-liners that explicitly rely on text for the joke, like if they use homonyms.)

Put another way, a reason we find one-liners so funny is we expect a setup, a pause, and a punchline but get a setup and punchline crammed together in a single statement. That split-second of realizing the setup and punchline are practically simultaneous is what surprises us.

And hopefully with that level of analysis, I've ruined the fun of one-liners altogether. :)
Beautiful
thats a good joke, friend
r/showerthoughts is that way, friend  (edit: grammar)
As a note, Dr Pepper is distributed by both Pepsi and Coke in different regions.
The CEO of Pepsi was fired today - they found traces of Coke in his system.

It could also be replaced by a semicolon. This specific one liner did not require a period, hence why it works. I think if something requires a period for readability, then its properly a two liner, though this instance does not apply.
[deleted]
[deleted]
I think one line isn't the same as one sentence. If it could reasonably said in a single go, and the punctuation is more for readability than to insert a pause, I think it should count as one line.

"The CEO was fired today, because they found Coke in his system." - That's a single sentence, but it reads more awkwardly. In the interest of brevity and humour, it can sometimes be beneficial to not force a line to be a single sentence. If the effect stays the same, I think allowing it to be two sentences should be fine.
That's another two-liner
this should be in twosentencesadness or twosentencehorror

I guess that's true if you equate "evolved-ness" with value. However, I don't see naturalistic evolution as giving living organisms any kind of value at all. In which case I guess you could everyone equal in terms of everyone being valueless, if you adhere to a naturalistic evolutionist frame of thought.
Not everyone is equal. Some are more beautiful than others, some are smarter than others, some are generally more skilled than others. Some are all at once (beautiful, skilled, smart) and so on.

I'm generally a low quality person. I'm ugly and dumb and a loser, so there's that.

I am contrary to this seemingly very popular belief, mainly because it discourages or cuts off the possibility of great one-liner jokes and it kills the spirit of the community by focusing on unimportant technicalities. I say unimportant, because, many of the greatest one-liners by some the greatest comedians, like Milton Jones, Mitch Hedberg, Gary Delaney, consist of more than one sentence.

Take the most famous Mitch Hedberg joke: "I used to do drugs. I still do, but I used to, too.", or a Tommy Cooper one: "My uncle was a great conductor. He was struck by lightening."

Not even the sub's rules mention that it should be one sentence, I don't know where you guys got this idea.  
Anyway, I think I got more than a fair share of your time. It's just that i do care about good jokes, that's all.
Well that is the name of the sub

I have a related story to tell here. I just came back from a camping vacation in Croatia. All was well, until this young Belgian couple arrived. They were really nice.

The day after they arrived, they decided to drink some cocktails. But not 1 or 2, they drunk *a lot*. Hours passed and the beach was getting empty. I was looking at some kids fishing, wanting to see what they'd catch, and then I heard All-Star by Smashmouth coming from my right. I looked there and on the beach, this young Belgian couple was having sex to the rhythm of the music (the fast part). And it wasn't subtle or anything, they had no shame smashing to Smashmouth while half the camping watched. They really weren't the smartest tool in the shed.
Go play

I'd also change "a lot" to "all the time", just to avoid that awkward rhyme.

Cultural conditions play into supply and demand. I guarantee that the personal fan market is depressed in SK due to the fan death phenomenon, which is no more than a way for the papers to conceal a suicide. 

The other side of it is that if it became commonplace, then we would see a rapid rise in dog deaths in the US until it reached similar per-capita levels to SK. If we stopped eating beef and cheese, why would we keep cows around?
See, that's all it is though. People starving to death is fine, but "Oh please spare that poor fwuffy wuffy poopsie from being eatten!" 

Like... you all realize that animal is going to be put to death either way, yeah?
I cant imagine that any American company would want to be associated with the butchering and distribution of dog meat. If culture around it shifted, then of course it would be commonplace.
Oh, really hoped for win-win situation. Some other time then.
Nope. Please see:

Well then shelter dogs should be sent to Korea and good dogs should be received back to US. Keeping only the good ones in states.
I wish the mods would start removing the two liners. In most cases it isnt even difficult to adjust the wording to make it a one liner. People are just lazy and its defeating the purpose of this sub.
I dont think we are ever going to agree on this. But the bar for whats racism shouldnt be lying on the ground. Not everything needs to be super serious. This stupid simple joke, which you agree with btw, is not oppressing anyone. Hell we could make a Hindu version for us Americans I bet. In India cows are deity. In US cows are diety.
It doesnt explicitly say so, but the tone of it is one of mockery and shaming of a race/culture. Its also important to note that Korea has outlawed dog meat and the majority of people frown upon it.
This post doesnt say anything about anyones opinion on Koreans eating dogs. Its just a play on words about Koreans eating dogs. Which youve agreed happens.
Lol
Thought that's China...
The sentiment against that part of Korean culture is definitely racist. That article has this quote:


"Cows are grown to be eaten; dogs are not. I accept that many people eat beef, but a cultured country does not allow its people to eat dogs."

This is extremely ignorant of Korean culture and history, a country that has been historically poor and oppressed by the Chinese and Japanese. The article says how cattle was necessary for farm work and dogs were abundant. If a person of Hindu beliefs said to not eat cow, Americans would laugh at them. But Americans telling people not to eat dogs is somehow morally different? Just because its true, doesnt mean that sentinments towards a cultural practice arent ignorant and racist.
https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2019/02/25/south-koreans-eat-more-than-2-million-dogs-every-year-but-thats-changing/2930025002/ 

Is it racist if its true?
So racism is suddenly okay on this sub now?
Do you mean in China or are you paid off by them too?
"According to the Korean Animal Rights Advocates (KARA), approximately 780,000 to 1 million dogs are consumed per year in South Korea. ... In June 2018, a South Korean municipal court ruled that killing dogs for their meat was illegal, though this does not make it illegal to consume dog meat."

Lets couple that with this:

"Each year in the US, approximately 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized (670,000 dogs and 860,000 cats)."

Let that sink in for a second.

Edit: I got serious on a oneliner sub. My apologies.
Wait since when did Koreans eat dogs I'm confused

What a load of pish.
There seems to be a bit of a generational divide on this. Young people more often seem to grasp a fairly simple truth.  A lot to what bullshit artists call political correctness is just at attempt to be less of an insufferably offensive ass hat. 

Saying innately offensive things and then justifying those offensive statements under the rubric of political incorrectness actually undermines the battle against political correctness.

Sex=gender
Except its not. It's sex in relation to social guidelines. Its the concept that there are male roles and female roles in society. Sex has nothing to do with gender beyond how people perceive your position within society based on your genitals. And again, there are more than two combinations of chromosomes, which means there are more than 2 sexes...
I mean hey to each his own, I just gave my opinion and if you agree thats totally cool. Life would be so boring if everyone agreed on everything. Have a fantastic day brother
Biological sex is gender.
1) there are more combinations of chromosomes than that
2) chromosomal composition does not dictate a construct of society. You're thinking of biological sex, which again, there is more than 2.
I actually think he said it better, to be honest.

They would have made two great distinct oneliners
Well, being limited to only 4 wives why would one waste time marrying one they couldn't immediately procreate with, unless of course as the cult leader, yeah I'm also atheist :), as the cult leader he didn't have to marry only 4.   I always though the purpose of plural marriage was to have a lot of kids coming from it.  

I think of the scene in Malcolm X where Malcolm is confronting Elijah Muhammad with him having sex with younger women and not claiming them or even supporting them.  Elijah's rationalization was that he was the last prophet, after him there would be no more, so he "must plant my seed in fertile soil."  The idea of course being to have as many children as possible. 

It didn't sit nor sell well to Malcolm, and even in a historical context for Muhammad it doesn't sit nor sell well with me, doubly for the fact that procreation can't even be the logic as Aisha wasn't old enough, quite yet.  Being that Muhammad was illiterate it amazes me he was able to gain such a cult following, then again same for Jesus, but we don't know that to be true during his lifetime, we do know for Muhammad though.  Jesus had marketing directors 100-200 years after he died.  :)
i agree with everything. its just that the event in discussion happened ~1500 years ago. im not trying to rationalise - have no incentive being an atheist- but this can be a social norm, atleast in theory. dont know for sure. need historians' point-of-view on this.
Religious scholars determined her age, and also the rationalization that the marriage happened when she was 6 but not consummated until she was 9, how does anyone know it wasn't consummated on the first night?  Sounds to me like religious scholars trying to rationalize pedophilic behavior.    


As far as social norms go, the scholars also determined Muhammad to be 53 when she was 9 or 10.  I don't care how one rationalizes it, it's an old man marrying a very very very young girl.  I mean what are the odds that this girl was even old enough to have children yet?  In my mind any way you cut it it's perverse, not in the sense of the word perverted but I'd be glad to consider that as well, but in the sense that it wasn't the common practice at the time.   Were there marriages with wide age discrepancies, sure, even in the last 120 years you can find a lot of cases where a 14 year old marries a 32 year old, but 9 vs 53, even then was very unusual and may in fact be the only historical case that can be cited with such a discrepancy where the girl was pre-pubescent.

"Oh, look at those two duckers, ducking!"
the opinion on this matter should come from the psychologists instead of religious scholars, which i believe you are referring to when you say 'scholars', because as per my knowledge, back then, it was a social norm. not quite sure how true it is, but if it is, psychology and philosophers, who are studying morality, should provide their input.

I remember thinking: "Ducking? Why does it autocorrect to ducking? That's not even a word!"

5 minutes later...

"Oh. Right. Ducking. As in to duck under something. Right. I knew that."
You should be ducking for cover!

As a Canadian, I approve of this
And he succeeded
The physical abuse of women is no laughing matter, and with that I agree wholeheartedly.

And if I had been so callous as to create and post a one-liner like this:

My mom told me to stop joking about beating women, so I got serious about it instead.

*That* would cross a line for me, because in the mind of the people I'm telling that joke to, the imaginary women would literally become a figurative punchline.

While the one-liner I made does use "battered women's shelter" in it, there is *ZERO* implication of active abuse to women themselves.  Instead, Im drawing on the double entendre of the word battered.

And in case you didn't catch it, I implied through both the protagonist  and the use of the wine drinking part that I do believe that jokes like these, this included, are in poor taste.  It's the reason I built it in there.

Hope you can understand and that you don't judge me too harshly for the quip.
I have to admit that I did.  I do a lot of word avalanches and we're constantly coming up with contrived titles for them and I could feel that same process kicking in on this one.  A bit clunky perhaps, but still managed it all in one line.
My mom was good and never asked me for anything, it seems; but she asked me to not laugh at woman beating jokes. It perpetuates it.

Well, two sentences disguised as one is still one sentence. I do agree with you although.

I totally agree with you, and think OP should delete this post. However, it could work with a comma rather than the first period, so OP should definitely repost with the correction made.
That might attract attention from snooflakes who aren't entirely comfortable with slavery and its toxic legacy. 

There's an expression of "being on the wrong side of history"... which can be regrettable. [Advice:] do try to avoid being included on the History side of being wrong.
Give me a brake!
Each of these millionaires had multiple millions of dollars, including John D. Rockefeller whose wealth peaked on the order of 900 million.  A cursory search only found me pre-crash figures, but if all together this tax brought in a billion dollars then that would amount to around $8 per capita in 1933 dollars, which would be equivalent to about ~$158 dollars today.
Dang! Really!!! How can I contact him? This only seems slightly morally ambiguous and illegal.

That's more of a bonus than a reason, people will have to pass that part of the board eventually. when they land in jail sure you get a high chance of them landing on those props, but the chances of getting into jail aren't that likely with only one spot (on the board) sending you to jail, and that's what I was referring to.

Edit: jail is a more likely spot to land on because it has a 1/40 chance plus the chances of going to jail. What I'm saying is theres about the same chance of "just visiting" as there is "in jail". What the OP was joking about is that rich people can go to "in jail", but I'm arguing that it's pretty unlikely to happen, not unlike the "real world"
&gt;If you think about it, the chances of landing on the tax spots or going to jail are pretty rare

You say that, but Jail is actually the most landed on spot in Monopoly. To the point where the best colour groups to buy are the oranges and reds - they're the most landed on groups due to their proximity to Jail.
Did he really? I need to learn more of this guys story
It's ok if you need to start small. Elon Musk came to this country with $2000.
Monopoly was made by an anti-capitalist during the depression. It was meant to be infuriating so people would associate capitalism with anger. Ironically it was bought out by a huge corporation and has since made them millions if not billions of dollars.

If you think about it, the chances of landing on the tax spots or going to jail are pretty rare (1/40 spaces sending you directly to jail, and 2/40 spaces taxing you, plus chance and community chest's less than a percent probability of doing either) which is indicative of the modern world that you are implying.
Depends on the perspective you're looking at it from. If you're of the mindset that they or their family members earned their wealth and deserve to keep it, then perhaps it isn't right. If you're looking at it as they're hoarding excess prosperity that could help the horribly impoverished who have been made unable to escape the situation, then it is unjust not to institute such a tax.

Edit: For reference of how much a millionaire was back then, $1 million in 1933 (when FDR was first elected) would be about $19 million today.

And as far as I've found, it seems 26 people in the US made over a million dollars in 1933, so that was considered the uber-rich of the day, similar to moderate billionaires.
That aint right
Not to mention you can actually afford property. Totally out of touch with reality.
But that Get out of jail free card tho
Make it a one liner by making it a statement and not a question. 

Example: You can make 5 pounds of fat look great by simply adding a nipple to it.
I think it was created during the great depression when FDR had put a 90% income tax on millionaires.
I genuinely dont know enough about history to dispute this, but something tells me rich people have always been immune to jail time and punishment even way back in the day.

Got em
I had a surprised reaction.  I voted for Kerry and really couldn't imagine that we would vote him in again.  That's why this coming election coming feels like history is gearing up to repeat itself.

The whole power structure in the US is skewed.  What should have been a people driven system has turned into a people driving system brought to you by the corrupted menage a troi the economy and government are having.

Breaking that codependent relationship is hard because of the complacency we've allowed ourselves.  Who needs to question themselves for the answers to real problems when the entire system is dictating to you what's right and wrong?  Add into the mix, those that hold steadfast to an outdated 50s style American dream, and those who wish to revise it and the turmoil that that creates on a popular level.  Notwithstanding, we are all struggling with the powerlessness we feel about being able to affect *any* change whatsoever because we're battling to be heard and appreciated on *all* fronts.

Regardless of whatever side your on, with a clear, honest view, one thing is very apparent (and I'm afraid pride won't allow a lot of people to see this):

The system we've developed into *does not work* for the good of *ALL* in it.

I wish people would just lay down their own personalities to see that.

So, yeah.  I wouldn't necessarily want to visit either.
that's true. I started hated the US when y'all voted in bush sr, and jr. I went to washington pre 9/11 and it was one of the best vacations I've ever had, but never again am I crossing the border. Like, ever.

op just outed himself for having stupid political opinions
By me...
Finally a non pun.
I think the vanilla ISIS thing was originally about the KKK/White Power/something something Patriots because of the all white thing. Thats the vanilla part of vanilla ISIS. 

A lot of people miss that.
You mean Ya'll-Qaeda ?
Honestly the KKK is a better punchline for that joke as the 2 are both terrorist organizations and the KKK is just a bunch of vanilla snow flakes.

Please report back and let us know if you get a thumbs up
A better recipient for vanilla ISIS would be white people terrorist attacks, which are by and large commited by the right wing nutjobs.
That would be a weird comparison considering antifa hasnt killed anybody. No, the bible waving gun toting militia types have a lot more in common with ISIS than antifa.

Not sure this is really a joke.  Neanderthals were unable to adapt to violence from encroaching anatomically modern humans as well as Cro Magnon interlopers, but they also disappeared due to parasites and pathogens, competitive replacement, competitive exclusion, extinction by interbreeding with early modern human populations, natural catastrophes, and failure or inability to adapt to climate change.

Rick was an easy nickname for Richard, and back in the medieval times rhyming names were popular. If you knew two Richards, the first was Rick and the second, since the name was popular and you already had a Rick, was rhymed over to a nickname of Dick. 

All you need from there is one of those second guys to like and use the name (the negative meanings behind it came centuries later) and for him to become well known enough for that name to become popular. Dick Turpin probably helped that out a lot, he was romanticised a fair bit.

Udder gender
Amazing play on words.

...I say this even though I default to saying udderly quite frequently.
I think it is essential, because bulls are male and cows are the udder gender.

It is a two-liner, though so instead of $0.02, I'll have to at least $0.01
I appreciate the constructive criticism, and joke-type clarification. Your 2 cents are duly noted. Thanks!

I'm going to be scratching my head a little harder on the next joke I attempt.
Because it's not essential to the joke. 

Also... Your joke is not a one-liner. It's a straight line/punchline format. 

$0.02
Why not? Gay cows need love too. Bulls just want to hit it and moooo-ve on.
Also, mostly reposts
Ohh wowza.. can't make a joke and can't take a roast. _Is this a crossover episode_

Don't listen to the lies of others posted here. Caesar was an 18th century Latin poet after whom the famous salad was named when he released a poem that apparently conjured imagery of murder and death through its allegorical use of crutons, lettuce and anchovies. The original preparation for the salad required a specialised tool in the so-called "Caesar-bladed knife", which had 23 prongs to allow full ingredient dispersal and chopping action in one swift motion. At the time it was traditional to exclaim aloud in Latin whilst using one, but only the most trendy cliques of poets would request a question rather than an exclamation. The question: Et tu, Brute?

I hope that clears it up mate
You've just made my day!
28 STAB WOUNDS.
No I'm not sure which one of them it was
Julius Caesar, famous Roman dude, was stabbed 23 times by his friends

Any salad is a Caesar salad if you stab it enough.

You must have nothing better to do, huh? I look forward to another convoluted, pseudo-intellectual rambling about how you think you're mentally superior because you can quote text and string long words that you barely learned yesterday together. 

Go on, type away. Edit your previous comments some more while you're at it. Keep shoveling shit out of that duffel bag inside your brain. Feed your ego.

I'm full. I've had my fun, so I'll be the better man and leave you to yourself. Having the last word doesn't mean you've won the argument, but I'll let you figure that out for yourself. 

I'm going to forget about you, and try to think of more shitty one-liners to post. If you reply to my posts, I'll assume you typed your replies in jest if it makes you feel better. You happy? Wait, that's a rhetorical question. I don't care anymore.

Adieu. For real this time.

You shush another adult? Obviously everything's okay: you trying to convince me or you? It ain't over till it's over sweetheart.
Is that a pun, or a play on words? I don't know, but it was funny.
This joke has two lines
No im gay
Yoooou fucker, lol.
Shhhhh, shhhhh. It's okay. It's over now.
Plot twist: the doctor OP asked was his podiatrist.
this shit is deeper than you realize
Are you okay?
Beautiful stuff. Do we have anything to say to each other really? Or should we both just move on?
To suggest I'm "trying to hide my true intentions" and obliquely suggest that "the real evil" is with me is so paranoiac and borderline insane, it's hard to do anything but simultaneously laugh and sigh. And while simultaneously saying "I am probably evil" without a whiff of bad conscience: all signs point to sociopath. 

I'm very educated in psychology, friend. You're blatantly projecting your subconscious onto me. You assume everyone is secretly as petty as you, even if they won't admit it.

 I want to live a healthy, fullfilling life filled with friends, pleasure, success, money, knowledge and joy. Those are my intentions, in plain view. 

The fact that you suspect others of hiding their intentions, any therapist or guru would tell you, is a clear sign that you are blind to your own intentions . . . You think your mind is a light shining and illuminating the external world: it is more of a mirror of your consciousness n
Despite all of this, let me praise the quality of your joke. It really does echo Hedberg, now that you mention it.
It's a cake:

cake
cake /kek  /
 noun
1 an item of soft sweet food made from a mixture of flour, fat, eggs, sugar, and other ingredients, baked and sometimes iced or decorated:
a fruit cake

Made of cream cheese: 

cream cheese
cream cheese
 noun [mass noun] soft, rich cheese made from unskimmed milk and cream.

So it is, in fact, both cheese AND cake.
This is TOO funny

It made my day ;)
It's beautiful to see the way you are learning from me.
I forgive you too.
I give it 3 thumbs up!
I forgive you man. It's all good.
Have a nice day devilboy

oh no
that's odd. he usually gives me a thumbs up.
Comments the in is joke real the
What an asshole.
Im the spokes person for a wagon wheel company.
On top of all this, you edit your previous comments to further elaborate just how butt-hurt you really *aren't*.
He who smokes pot, and eats spicy wings.

High on toilet.
Didnt you say goodbye? I could have sworn that you were finished. 

Vocal inflections do not translate onto text. I don't read everything with the assumption that the person typing them is speaking in jest, or with any emotion at all. Also, you don't get much tonality out of a single sentence.

If a comedian told a joke, and a heckler said, "I think you mean [pun]", I'm pretty sure the comedian would generally say "fuck off, you don't write my shit." Despite the lightheartedness of the comment. And if the heckler retorts with a sarcastic "I don't give a shit", than the comedian would probably call him/her out on the bag of shits the heckler keeps in their back pocket. 

All the name-calling, and convoluted comments in response to this do is further prove that you got butt-hurt because I said you overanalyzed my joke (thanks for complimenting it by the way, I was trying to emulate Mitch Hedberg, and you basically validated my emulation). On top of all that, you compare me to an insect, also compare me to a teenage girl, summarize one of your comments as "*go die*", verbally abuse your possibly less intelligent "friends" rather than educate them, and you insinuate that you whip dogs "*for their own good*", all while denying the fact that you want the last word. 

How am I supposed to leave this alone? I'd like to think I've been pretty transparent as to how ridiculous this whole thing is, but I'm still having fun stoking the flame. Am I evil for it? Yeah, probably, but I'd argue the true evil lies within those who try to hide their true intentions. 

For someone from NYC, you have some thin skin, pal. I'm from south Texas, we're all a bunch of stubborn mules down here.
I'm giving you the whip, because you're acting like a dog, but it's for your own good.
On the most basic level, it's borderline evil to insult people and then insult them about being offended about being insulted, and on the most basic level, that's what you did here.
pretty sad that in one post you both accuse me of "caring too much" and insult yourself, calling yourself a nobody.
pretty sad that in one post you both accuse me of "caring too much" and insult yourself, calling yourself a nobody.
You're not a nobody man. I believe in you.
It was a comic book/spider joke. Race had nothing to with it.
Wow. So much effort went into that response. I don't know where all this name-calling came from if "*it's all love here*". You sure have a weird way of showing how *not* irritated you are by a **nobody** on the internet.

I don't think you realize just how offended you were by my "*wackest, most snot-nosed comment bro*". Maybe you shouldn't try to correct someone else's punchline that they felt proud of.

Adios.

What's up Dr. Phil? This response is weak son. Weak and ineffectual. It 100% sincerely did not even enter my mind about "getting the last word" or anything like that. When people stay stupid shit, I call them out. Seems like you're lost in the sauce my guy. 

I came on this thread, made a light-hearted ass pun, and you made the wackest, most snot-nosed comment bro, which literally made me laugh it was so pathetic. Then I was saying you're acting pathetic and it's mad funny. That's when you're weak-ass defense mechanisms kicked in, straight up telling me like a total clown and buffoon that I don't actually think you're dumbass behavior is funny, which [L M F A O @ U] I absolutely do: telling me I'm angry about your irritating me. 

Kid, you couldn't irritate me if you wanted to. I'm straight up laughing at you. If u want you can reply again and I can laugh more. Or you can keep drowning in the staple-soup of your reflected ego-consciousness lmao. 

love u bruh
Even though I get the joke I immediately thought that the reason nothing surprise him is because hes made of ice which is ridiculous

You're the one that keeps responding to my ridiculous comebacks.

a) I'm just having fun.

b) It is as important to me, as it is to you, to have the last word in this nonsensical arguement.

c) I can't say no to a free hug.

If you really didn't give a shit, you'd never have mentioned you had shits to give in the first place. Now, you can either analyze my text, and waste time coming up with a response that I can then analyze and waste time responding to, or you can read this, say "fuck this guy" and move on with your life.
Ok, now I'll tell you my thought about your thought about my thought about your thought about my thought about your thought about me.

(a) I'm not angry, and it's pathetic/hilarious that someone I've never met or spoken to thinks I'm angry.

(b) it's even more pathetic, and even a little sad (hmu if u need hug bruh) that you would take pleasure in someone else's anger. 

Do you want to keep going with your infantile game? I'm up for some more entertainment/anthropology.
I think you're cute when you're angry.
I think you're talking about yourself bud.

I think it would communicate better if it said:

I had to rewind halfway through reading it. Plus any time I see the word ice I think of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

There used to be this psychic in town and then one day we're drove by and she was apparently out of business and my bf was like "huh,  guess she didn't see that coming".
Mine was scolding me for being too submissive, so I packed her bags and left.
So who cares

Fair enough. I hoped the ellipsis could be used to join the clauses together but I stand corrected 
My girlfriend thinks I'm a stalker and we haven't even met.
This seems more like a 2liner.

To be one I think it would have to be something like:

"My girlfriend thinks I'm a stalker just because she doesn't know she's my girlfriend."
Transparent was actually the name of a TV show starring Jeffery Tambor about a trans woman parent. Looks like you and the creators of that show think on the same wavelength. Haha.

Man I am so terrified of the government that I don't steal; because as we can see from current events that if you think you can get away with stealing and burning shit people go to town, literally.   


This is such a banal line it is painful, if you flunk your exams at school or uni, and are terrified of failing does that make the institution terrorist? Of course not. Terrorism is the oppression of all other ideologies through a campaign of acts planned in secret later claimed to create a climate of fear.   


Almost no one in the west lives in actual fear of the government. If you do, you are delusional; because the real stick is the gov really doesn't care about you.

For basketball, for hockey and all of the sports, they need a lot of room. We dont need it. We have people in that space. So we break all of these records.  Really we do it without like, the musical instruments. This is the only musical: the mouth. And hopefully the brain attached to the mouth. Right? The brain, more important than the mouth, is the brain. The brain is much more important.
Dont beat around the bush.
Dude cmon its not that bad
You made me join the subreddit. Nice job.
The original author was some high schooler in 1975.
Elton John is gay. The organ is a penis
Nah it would be two sentences. It would only be said like this if there was visual representation, because otherwise it is not obvious at all that you are recording. Im being pedantic I like this joke its just not a one liner
can someone explain this to me?
It would have been split by a semi colon, but for the post purposes...
Am I wrong or is this two lines
Mainly
Lockjaw - cook thugless
Which makes sense cause that was when Elton John was probably most popular, aside from 1997.
Best one liner yet!! I literally laughed out loud!! 
Dude
Two lips on the organ
I remember this joke from high school (1975).
Oh my god this one took me a second...
I bet that was a disappointment for them.
Lol it's funny cuz "pianist" sounds like the organ
Bruh its not that serious
Repost, not yours, but still a good oneliner. You should give credit to the original author. Your karma farming will still get you points.
Oh, THAT organ!
We should try branching out to some new jokes, because otherwise our wives could leaf us

Haha! ... slice of lime, rub its peel around the rim of the martini glass, curl it into the shape of a corkscrew, toss it in (&amp; don't say voil, because that's the name of a different drink, not a Cosmo). It's basically this whole big ol' visual appeal ritual when prospecting for a dancer.
I want to have sex with you
Olive, please. Dont let me down on this one.
So... whats the twist?
What in the Dickens?
A common garnish for martinis other than olives is a twist of a lemon rind, or orange sometimes.
The 2% means percent fat
Okay, now I dont know if youre just messing with me.  :)  

If not, Charles Dickens. British author. Wrote Oliver Twist.
Who is Dicken?
Theyre referring to Oliver Twist. One of Dicken's stories.
I dont get it. Why is twist an alternative to an olive?
It doesn't allow or condone slavery or killing. Not killing for the sake of killing is a commandment, but war for the right cause and self defense are sometimes warranted. 
Slavery is acknowledged as a real thing and it tells slaves how to glorify God as slaves, but it doesn't say anywhere it's ok.

Is the joke that he lost so much weight that he ceased to be?
Im sorry for your loss
Does that makes me no liner?

It's a real shit joke when he asks a simple question and you can answer it without having to think about it.  

It's more like a kindergarten quiz:   Dogs are messy pets.  Name another animal that can stain your carpet.

You should put this in r/dadjokes too
Wow, this oneliner goes all the way to 3!
You could literally replace it with a Mime and it would be the same joke. And you'd be OK with it. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean others shouldn't be able to view and enjoy it.
Also how is this offensive? They literally can't talk. That's the entire joke. An observation. Get over yourself.
Don't be sorry about a harmless joke. Be sorry for the People who take it so seriously and get offended on others behalf.

If it's logically incorrect then clearly the OP is talking about something else that is much more logically correct.

In this case, Ben Roethlisberger and his offensive guards. Ya know, the guys that play between the offensive tackles and the center?

So? Don't you share or tell jokes that other told you before? I think OP just heard it and shared it (hopefully after checking if it was shared before). As for the quality, that's up to reddit to decide. Apparently at least 13 people enjoyed it as they upvoted it.

Who's on first.

It's implying that most people are Chinese.  It's true that China has the largest population, but they don't make up more than 50% of the world population so the joke is not true.

I think it's a type of anti-joke. I think. Like, he is making a claim that there is no such word that starts with N and ends with G, with the joke that nothing is such a word.

Okay, I'll bite... How is it two lines? Oh, and as a soon to graduate seminarian, I work in ancient Greek every... single... day, including writing - so having ready access to it for this post was a nice benefit.
Thats two lines. Is a snake thats exactly 3. 14 metres in length considered a thon? /s

Also had to get the Greek keyboard for this one
Nag
Now do Obammie
They certainly are.
However, in maths, it is only a line if it is straight.
Yes, it does.
[deleted]
Dammit. This one got me.
if snake= 3.14 "meters":
     snake=thon
     thon = true




Yes
Because after a dot, the length of numbers?
Ba dum *crash*
The while figure of pi? Well I'll he darned
#the real joke
All snakes are one liners.  

Usually a curvy line, but a line nonetheless.
And if I included the whole figure, itd cease to be a one liner. Sometimes you just gotta compromise.
To Elon Musk maybe
No because 3.14 exactly is not pi
If Kermit wasn't a Muppet, he would be named Kerm

Laughed wayy to hard at this.
It's not easy to search because they disallow [spiders](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler).
As of this moment 415 others disagree with you but that's cool after all everyone is welcome to an opinion and clearly rather than just moving on to the next joke you decided it was worthwhile stopping by to voice your opinion which is totally sweet and I appreciate the time taken to do that and apologise of course as NO ONE likes a run on sentence that just meanders meaninglessly along without any care for punctuation of any kind I mean what kind of psycho forces that level of suckage into a sentence where even your brain has to pause for a breath where clearly there are no commas!!!

I wonder what it's like to be blind?

Can't quite picture it...
Nah u did an excellent job. Thanks a lot!
Not trying to one up you. You wrote the joke, it's your idea. I tried to tidy it up a little shorter. Good joke, I like it.
Wait thats way better...

I like the optimism, but pandemics can last for months if not years. The risk will persist for a long time unless we find a cure or vaccine. It won't be a victory you'd want to celebrate, looking at the lives lost and damage done. Moreover, if the fight stretches on longer, the celebrations won't be fun. Being able to out on the streets slowly would be a good enough reward, and then it would be life as usual.

I don't see 2020 helping with greatness. If only, just the opposite.
This is a great oneliner, but it is obvious that youve forced it to be one sentence. Its not your fault. I think people on this subreddit are too square for requiring a oneliner to be one sentence. Look at oneliners done by masters such as Milton Jones, Tim Vine, Gary Delaney. 
My neighbors have recently made a sex tape. Well, obviously, they dont know that yet. - Gary Delaney

That's fascinating!!! Honestly, I was kinda dumbfounded when it didn't come up in the first search - since it's been around quite a while. It's got me wondering WHY, though, since I tried several word combinations to double-check myself and still didn't find the rather comprehensive list you cobbled together.
Not that I am bothered by yours, but here are dozens of reposts https://www.google.com/search?q=%22i+can%27t+turn+that+down%22+site:reddit.com
Nice
Turn down for what?
*rubs forehead twice*
Interesting... I searched Reddit before posting and nothing popped up. I searched just now, though, and see it was posted here three years ago. That's the only instance of it I can find. Given that it's not against the rules to repost, though, and that it's been three years - I'm gonna guess this is okay. I'm sorry if you disagree. All is well. Be blessed.
Repost.
Love it!!!! Great stuff!!!

The next one I would appreciate your consent to post is ***" I lost my job at the massage parlor because I rubbed people the wrong way "***. I searched several variations and find no trace of it having ever been posted - so I believe I'm in the clear. Perhaps you can search or double-check as well, though, and let me know if it's okay to proceed. As an alternative, I'm also considering ***"I tried working in a muffler factory, but that was too exhausting."*** Same thing as above applies.

Exactly my point... I know its a repost and never claimed otherwise - so theres no need to remind me over and over again. You couldve simply upvoted the first one who pointed this out. I also know its not prohibited to repost, since someone who sees it today may not have seen it any of the other times its been posted. This is supported by its 300+ upvotes and climbing. If youve seen it, as clearly you have, great. Keep on scrolling to the next post.
And yet, 4 out of 5 parent comments on this post are about it being a repost.

Glad to hear you've heard every joke! You must be a ball at parties!
Awesome dude can I post this next week?
If this sub allowed original content only and/or no reposts - 95% of its content would go POOF!!!
And this repost.

This joke really gets around.
Yes.
The only thing I have to fear is THESE FUCKING REPOSTS

Unless, of course, they were overtaken by a group of larger and tougher rabbits on their way to a spritual discernment weekend who were planting grass along the way which, of course, would be... A superceding, retreating, seeding, receding hare line.

Reading jokes as a rabbi is funnier?
wow,,i really like it..the way it comes out almost like a pun
Steal away!!! This one goes back to my childhood, 40-something years ago, and I cannot claim original ownership. I also modified it to fit a 'oneliner' format. The original joke, at least as I know it, is "what do you call 100 rabbits lined up single file and marching backwards?"... "A receding hare line".
I read that as rabbi the first time and it was a lot funnier.
wow wow wowlet me steal this one right here
Wonderful
This is a street joke old as time

While this may be true for most of them, some cum around.
Pro Tip: **READ THE SIDEBAR:**

&gt;**A oneliner is a succinct, funny or witty remark. This should all fit into the title.**

&gt;**Generally, if your joke would be more funny if it was split into a title and body section, its probably not a oneliner.**

A palindrome is something that says the same thing if you read it forwards, or backwards. In this context, Dr Awkward when reversed becomes "drawkwa rD". If you clean it up it becomes "dr awkwa rD" then "dr awkwarD" and finally "Dr Awkward" again.

Thats because this is a repost
Although it's implied it's tit for tat between two people, and commonly understood to mean that, it doesn't explicitly state that, so the eye taken doesn't necessarily belong to the original aggressor, just that one is taken, it doesn't state from whom. If the second eye is taken from a third person rather than the first, the chain can indeed continue until all are blind.
thats an interesting thesis, are you trying to say even if there are odd number of people, still the last person would have 2 eyes, making it even number of eyes, but i think Gandhi meant person to person, so i dont think a person can make themself blind with their one eyes to their other eye, let me submit it to other communities and get others opinion.
That's actually quite clever, well done.
Actually that's an interesting mathematical conundrum, and excepting birth defects and people losing an eye through other means, there would still be an even number of eyes in the world even if there is an odd number of people. Why not submit it to Numberphile or Scam School?
You turkey.

Yeah, there was no way to leave it out, really. It primes the mind to read it with a Bart Simpson-style nonchalance. I could have used a comma, I suppose, as a few have pointed out that there are two full stops, and thus not, strictly speaking, a one-liner. Meh.
Meh is doing a lot of work in this joke
I mulled over several more awkward possibilities before settling on this one. The struggle is to get a complex (and suitably jarring) idea into the most concise form that is also comfortable enough to read.

Reminds me of my wife wiping down our groceries. We buy groceries and she wipes then with a clorox wipe to feel comfortable there's no Coronavirius on them. I've brought up to her before that the Clorox package says the item must remain wet for four minutes for disinfection, which I'm sure is nowhere close to happening. 

If in theory there was Coronavirius on any of those items, ex someone in the store coughed or sneezed on / around them before we got to them, she'll now prob have her guard down about washing hands after touching them due to the false sense of security.
Said the widdle baby
If you hold your ear up to a stranger's leg, he'll ask you what the hell you're doing. If you tell him what the he'll you're doing, he'll think you're insane.

If he thinks you're insane, he'll probably call the police. If he calls the police, they'll take you to a mental institution for the night.

If they take you to a mental institution for the night, you won't have to sleep next to your dead wife, which will be good-- because the bitch is starting to stink.

This has a similar tone to something I floated by here a while back:

Ill accept it with origami because im betting 99% that know what origami is dont know what kirigami is. 

I used to do origami and I didnt even know what kirigami was.

Really? Is it amezzaning?
The name of the sub, bud
Not a one-liner. Funny. But not a one-liner.
I appreciate the joke, it made me laugh, but I felt like this needed to be said.
Origami = Ori(meaning paper) + gami(meaning fold)
Origami doesn't use scissors.
Kirigami is origami with cutting.
This joke is way better than it should be.
Thats what its all about.
R/twoliners
Its not one sentence tho
Two lines.
Im gonna need help finding who asked
Covid might slide into your DMs
r/twoliners

Putting it all in the title doesn't make it a one liner. If it's more than one sentence (or is forced into one but would clearly work better as two) then it's not a one liner. Why is this so hard for people to understand? All I see in this sub lately are two liners and shower thoughts. smh 
Yeah, so?....

I have bad news for you: if youre the one who ate the hot wings, its not gonna matter.

Why would I store used napkins in my glovebox and if I did for whatever reason I'd easily be able to tell that they had been used, especially if used with hot wings.

I've often heard people say, "The word gullible is written on the ceiling." Then you look and there is nothing there and you realize you are the gullible one.

I usually don't eat hot wings in the car, but this will certainly be useful next time I'm taking a car shit.
This joke is so bad, it should be a lout

You know what, I DIG you so youre invited!
This is horrible. Im blocking you.

This joke makes me want to throw a BLOCK party where everyone can SQUARE dance to my favorite type of music: BEDROCK n roll.

Good on you for citing, but at the same time Tom Waits' album NightHawks at the Diner is 45 years old, so that radio DJ may have gotten it from Waits.

My favorite concept is to turn an argument into a pissing match where you all people names. (And yes its different because its not i the concept of joke). I also think that it is less of a compassion problem, and more of a disconnection from reality problem.

Usually a cars gas mileage is something like 30/mpg. Or 30 miles per gallon. Driving 30 miles burns one gallon.

I think the joke is that a bikini is a two piece. So making it back in one piece implies that a piece was lost.
Please explain
Except that I have clearly violated no actual rules. So you may be thinking of another sub, bud.
A one liner is a joke that is all one sentence/line. You just have to sort the sub by top to see hundreds of examples of actual one-liners. You could also take even a cursory glance at the subs rules tl;dr, which state that the whole joke should be in the title.
So what doesn't count? The title line, or the body line? Each are one line-- and the sub allows the additional body.
This is in no way, shape, or form a one liner.
Why are you telling people??! Maillot own business!

Its good, but theres a kind of cheese thats Gouda.

Hands Up !
Nice I'll take it
Cheeseheads like me it, nevercheesers hate it but who cares about them they dont have a soul
CAREFUL!!! Spooning leads to forking.
No, you spoon, I eat it with Almond Milk (which is better than cow milk, imo)
If youre lactose intolerant, do you eat cereal with a fork? Im lack toes intolerant: I hate frostbite amputee victims.

Lol. I see what you did there.
Actually, its the greatest of all time cheese.
Damn that was great.  This cheesy one liner is the Goat!
Grate-est...
Pretty good.
Very less. I had some recently after not having dairy for a while, and found out after a thing happened that it was affecting me :(
Goat cheese is pretty good, yeah. It's not as annoying as cow cheese. TBH, I prefer almond milk, which is a little more dense, but IMO, is better than cow milk. I'll try the trader Joe's Cheddar and Gouda. How much is it at your area?
Should've been "GOAT cheese is the Greatest Of All Time."
Goat cheese is terrible. Spare yourself.
As a fellow non-tolerator of lactose, I cant recommend Trader Joes goat cheddar &amp; goat Gouda enough! They still give me some discomfort but its nothing compared to cows milk/cheese &amp; theyre sooooo delicious!
Traditional goats cheese is a lil nasty imho (some people love it, too soft for my taste, the flavor is pretty good) but they make a Gouda at Trader Joes out of goat milk &amp; it is AMAZING!
Thats my situation too! Cheese from cows milk gives me horrible pain but I can eat goat cheese Lactaid-free with only minimal suffering!
I can't stand the stuff personally. But it is worth trying once at least.
Fun fact: goat cheese doesnt have lactose. Or at least significantly less than cow cheese. I had a friend who was lactose intolerant but ate goat cheese all the time!
Sadly, I can't eat that much cheese, as I'm lactose intolerant, but try something from Boar's Head or Hillshire Farms
Ahh, sorry, wasn't familiar with the acronym.
I need to try goat cheese though.  Any good?
No, everybody is classless
many times, people will say something is the GOAT, which is an acronym for Greatest Of All Time, so what OP is saying is that G.O.A.T. Cheese is the greatest cheese of all time.
I don't get it.

I learned it with a b instead of c. But it doesnt matter really. Im in Calc 3 now, and when my professor happens to write it, he'll pick any random letters, like y= dx+ e for example
this isnt a one liner, this encompasses **all** lines
You are correct. The original equation of a line is ax+by=c

OPs form is used when you have a slope. A is the constant that is usually put in front of x and B is usually put in front of y in two dimensional algebra. It is just convention though.

Edit: Actually it seems to be a regional thing: https://www.mathsisfun.com/equation_of_line.html#Countrynote
Ik but you can't just use any letter
Slope can only be represented as m and
Intercept can only be represented as c
Please explain
The m in mx and the b or c are just placeholders where any number can go
[deleted]
Ah I see, the ol r/substakenliterally
technically correct, the best kind...
Isn't it y=mx+c instead of b?
Just take youre upvote and get out of here

It's more about just getting letters and numbers wrong.  
As a point of interest when I was diagnosed with dyslexia many decades ago they had only just come up with the term.   
The term they were using then was 'left eyed'. And that is not far off. You can write a book with your left (or "wrong") hand but it will be very slow and not a lot of fun. That's how I feel when I try and read a book. ...I think.
He's a lumberjack and he's okay.
As a dyslectic that is happy to laugh at himself I think it's a great joke! It definitely "works".  
Most the descriptions below are an oversimplification of dyslexia.
This is the equation for one (straight) line.
l
To see this in action do the following:
Go to https://www.desmos.com/calculator
Type in:
y = x


M is the rate of change
I.e.: y = 2x
B is the initial value of Y
I.e.: y = 3
A complete example would be
y = 4x + 6


Im bad at reddit markup
At the lumberjack agency we just call them employees
Am dumb. Don't get it. Anyone care to explain?
It's still more creative than most versions of the joke.
Really is a two part joke though.
This is the best variant on the idea I've seen here, well done.
Can you leave us alone, we just want to lumber
"Our lumberjack just isn't cutting it anymore"
If you need a lan to save his job, work with him to hatchet.
Agreed, I feel like I saw too much.
I feel like you didnt need the part after the comma.
See, now that's a joke. Dyslexia is about mixing up letters that exist in a word, not adding random new letters. The original "joke" does not work.
I remember one of Brandon Rogerss videos had a bit like this
But Y though?
Aight, just gonna leave it at that. My joke is shit and im an asshole
Did you hear about the dyslexic insomniac agnostic? He stayed up all night wondering if there really is a dog.
Swapping letters for other letters is a [rare or non-dyslexic trait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristics_of_dyslexia). The most common one that most people are familiar with is getting words/letters backwards. The full list of common symptoms is at the link I provided.

What you are alluding to is closer to [Dysgraphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysgraphia).
Thats the joke
Dyslexia is a disorder where you mix up letters for other letters. In the the word "dyslexic" the letter after the "e" is "x". Change that letter to a "p" and you get "epic". Which is what the joke is based around, mixing up letters for other letters.
There's no 'P' in dyslexic.
If this is over your head, then I'm not going to explain it to you.

I was at the airport a little while ago and took a sneaky glance at the ladys boarding pass next to me. Then I texted my wife this lady next to me just flew in from Beijing. She quickly hid her boarding pass and then we realized the jig was up for both of us.  Never acknowledged it.
It took me a minute, I thought this was some kind of blog lmao
What's the joke? You said that it's not misspelled but it is. Where's the funny part?

Bingo, we have a winner 
Blind guide dog owners pick up their guide dogs poop after them. Most of them have hands, and they even have a dog that can help them with it.
Oh, I thought you meant the not-blind guide dog users, because guide dogs are trained so that blind people can pick up the dog poop (in a bag). Basically the dog points out their poop for their owner.
Damn and I though I was being original.
I never said blind people are idiots. You're putting words in my mouth. Just think for a minute. How would they know where the poop is at? It would be embarrassing to run your hands on the ground and hopefully not have it land in poop.
I guess if there were schools in sky scrapers they would be very upper class.
Oh, I thought most guide dog owners are merely blind. Blind people aren't idiots.
Especially the blind ones.
Confucius say: He who stands on toilet is high on pot.
courtesy of Jimmy Carr?
The dog is trained to wait until given permission to poo. They then poo where they are told making it easy for their owner to find and dispose of.  They are rewarded with a treat for that behavior. 

Source: MIL has a guide dog.
Guide dog owners are blind...
Yep, I heard that one before!
How about this variation: The janitor at my school was always smoking pot, he was high maintenance.
Years ago I was waiting at a red light and watched a blind guy's dog take him to a trash can.  The dog then squatted and dropped a loaf, the guy took out a plastic bag and picked up most of it, so the dog gave him some kind of sign and the guy picked up the rest, tied the bag and tossed it in the trash.
More importantly, who picks up your shit posts?
You read it correctly.  If they *don't* wear hearing protection they're irresponsible, but if they *do* wear hearing protection they are ear-responsible.
I SAID: PEOPLE WHO USE HEARING PROTECTION ARE BEING EAR-RESPONSIBLE!!
When one loses the sense of sight, the others become more attuned to fill the void.

Yeah...
I hate you
Why this thing does not get reported... what type of bogus is this?
I actually thought you did that on purpose. Like a second level to the joke. It was a joke though...right?
Yeah, you're right. I should probably work on my English. Here. Take my upvote.

I agree, the bottom 10% is dragging the average down. Thanks bell curve!  And the top 1% has 80% of the smarts.

Sorry, but it's a Rodney Dangerfield joke.
My son was born 14 minutes ago and even he's heard that one before...
I don't like cocaine (setup)

(ability to pause)

however (hightening)

(ability to pause)

I love it's smell (punch)

in my opinion, a one liner would not work if it were delivered in multiple lines or with a pause
in my opinion the delivery doesn't change the type of joke but i'm just glad you understand what i mean
Hol up
I don't *do* cocaine, I just like the smell of it
Keyword: used
If you replace the comma with a "but" or " however" it is one line. It's a one liner.
TIL commas are periods in disguise,
I'm not addicted to cocaine, I just like the smell.
I completely get what your saying.. but when I say it, I don't pause. So it comes down to the setup and delivery. depending who says it.
Id rather take one panty liner.
Your use of the plural "gasolines" makes this comment so much worse. It's like you are such a connoisseur of burnt bodies you can determine which octane was used just by the smell wafting off the corpse.
I don't like cocaine (setup)

(you can pause here, that's what makes it not one line)

I like the smell of it (punchline) 

this is a two liner. a one liner would be something like "whiteboards are remarkable" because you can't phrase it the way i did above

whiteboards are

(pause here and the joke doesn't work)

remarkable
Literally one sentence.
It's one sentence though..
My brother told me this a few months ago. I told him that it was true comedy gold. 
every stand up in Ireland says this three times per set

Hey look an actual one liner!
Whoops. That went over my head. Not on purpose. I'll leave it up to the mods if they want to remove my post or not.
A true one-liner.
I don't like Gasolines, I just like the scent of it coming off of burnt corpses.
Aww. Did your feelings get hurt because you don't understand basic joke formats and someone pointed it out?
Here's a one liner: go fuck yourself.
Two people are speaking. Explain how that is one line?
It is when spoken.
Not a one-liner.
Well, at least it means it didn't go over your head...

Not many one-liners make me laugh immediately. This one did.
Maybe I'm a purist or something but one liners should be a single sentence with no breaks. Run-ons haven't been allowed since primary school so they shouldn't be here.

We know that was the joke. But theres no whoosh, here. Me purposefully misunderstanding it allowed me to incorporate an element of misdirection in my joke, which made it a little stronger than if I had made the joke as a stand-alone. If you read only the first and last sentence of mine, what I was doing becomes a little more clear.
There are 3 types of people in the world. Those that can count and those that can't.
I think if you actually do drag it out, the punchline loses a lot of its punch, due to losing its close proximity to the set up. I totally get what youre asking for, but I think the trade off of going that meta with it devalues the impact of the punchline. 

However, I hope Im wrong, and will keep checking back to see if anyone can find a way.

You're not wrong my friend, but thanks for degrading me.

Wow! I just googled this joke (which is what I should have done before I posted it), and it is nowhere *near* original. I found a reference to it here on Reddit from 6 years ago, and there are tons of other references. Makes me wonder about all of the *other* jokes I thought were my own. Sheesh!
No worries!
Just because it isn't original doesn't take off the fact that you still thought of it and is quite funny. Didn't mean it to be a hate comment just a comment, nonetheless great joke!
Really?! Crap. I guess Im not as original as I thought. But then again, its an easy joke to come up with, so I shouldnt expect that Id be the only one. Thanks for the heads up!
I somehow managed to look over the word "door" like 8 times and spent like 10 minutes trying to understand how this is funny

It doesn't bother me as much as you might thibk it does, but you shouldn't take jokes from Facebook. Remember the cycle: 4chan&gt;Reddit&gt;iFunny&gt;Instagram&gt;YouTube and then back itonically to 4chan
Lol.  I just heard it on FB and thought it was a pretty funny one-liner.  Checked first to make sure it wasn't a repost (hate that), and posted cause it's in the spirit of this sub.  Sorry, if it bothers you, but it belongs here.
Maybe not here, but I've seen it on YouTube, and that means something

There is no hidden meaning he just tried to pay with ketchup
That was twisted!
The joke is that "I tried to buy a hot dog with ketchup" could either mean that he tried to buy a hot dog that had  ketchup on it, or that he tried to buy a hot dog with ketchup as the currency.
the pun is that he tried to pay using ketchup rather than money I tried to buy a hot dog with cash but replace cash with ketchup
Please explain
I am still not getting it.  Is ketchup a pun?  What is the non-literal ketchup?
He tried to pay for the hotdog with litteral ketchup as currency
Is "ketchup" supposed to be said in a way that means a fork of money?
He tried to pay for the hotdog with "ketchup" instead of cash

You literally wrote it in the definition C, lol:

&gt;c:a final stage of society in Marxist theory in which the **state has withered away** and economic goods are distributed equitably

You don't even understand the definitions you quote, and you dare to call me retarded. Nice one, dude.

&gt;Well learn to duck before you guys have your "revolution" you cute soulless waste of oxygen. Fucking retard.

Learn to fucking research and understand things properly. Learn to fucking behave. And when did I say I'm a communist or anything? I only said an actual fact, and you assumed I'm a communist.

Also, nice stalking. I've also decided to stalk your profile, and judging by how many downvotes you've received in political subs and posts, and how ahistorical, wrong and stupid your comments are, seriously, go read and learn things before talking about them, because it's just pathetic to debate and get insulted by people like you for not being able to accept a fact.

It's easy to get stuck when contemplating OTJ issues and see no way out. Professional guidance might've saved this person by providing alternatives to giving up going up. For example:  Pair with someone who likes to go down. This simple solution can increase personal satisfaction and eliminate a too depressing work environment. Results could also include  a continued rise in the company. Instead this person plummeted into the ranks of the unemployed.

I don't get it
Yknow Im startin to think this guy didnt actually kill him self
I can't bear puns like this.  Especially if they're in Spanish, then they're oso bad.
Epstein did not kill himself.
The joke is that they shot his paw instead of his father. A common cry to the sheriff in the old west movies was from some kid whose dad just got shot
I'd be lion if I said I got this right away.
Animal crackers recently became popular again. They've been a wafer a while.

ahhhhhhh big brains
No
I know this is old but I was going through my messages and noticed that it  also swaps from past tense to present tense. Is that also part of making your joke funnier? Coz personally I have only ever asked how *could* you turn that down?
Could someone explain the joke?
Oh yeah why dont you make me?
I like it!
Do you get Readers Digest?
Seems pretty straightforward to me.
I've heard one similar...
A three-legged dog enters a saloon in the old west, slides up to the bar and says, "I'm looking for the man... who shot my paw".
My advice to everyone.  ;)
Omg, you just took my brain and turned it to mush!
And why is it always upvoted?
It gave me a chuckle.
How about you stop telling op what he can tell people to do.
Clean and wholesome :)
I was going to give a detailed comment after reading the text but then I saw the sub Reddit and now I am like, ya never mind.
Hey fuck you bud, you cant tell me what to do.
So what does position 68 sound like?
Wtf?...
There is already...
And I always lie
Bummer, man.
Stop telling me what to do.
Thats a clever one
Indeed... But be cool, it's all in good fun
The post is telling you what to do
it's so subtle I don't get it lmao
Make them beg.
Bloody hell take my upvote.
Thats cold man.
Subtle but good.

I'm quite aware. How is this at all a one liner or a joke?
I am the most humble person I know.
It is the fear of large words.
Okay?
Thanks.

I masturbated in public once... I was quickly yanked off the street by the cops.
Stuart Francis is pretty hilarious! Good joke!
This doesn't qualify. Keep in mind that in r/oneliners, we post jokes.
Can I just leave my body and pick it up when it's ready?
Shout out to my existential friends - if that even matters
your and you.. er.
 Its like a small pause and a slight inflection
Shout out to my sentient friends - we know we're here
Nice one, made me chuckle.
I highly doubt it, the account isn't even a day old, and this is the 3rd time I've seen this post on this subreddit this week
How many times do we have to read this same "joke?"
That advertisement is a joke 
Pretty sure this subreddit is for jokes not advertising
Well, clearly I won't be able to use the one where I got hurt
Use what, the other hand?
Overmorrow is tomorrow's tomorrow
I'm gonna use this if I ever hurt my hand

I really can't wait for this stupid joke to die. It's been an entire decade since I first saw this joke and it's been making rounds ever since.

hindsight is 2020.
Making a dark joke= being a homicidal maniac

We live in a society
I'm stupid and don't get the joke therefore the joke it's stupid
Depends on who you ask
It should be "and" rather than "but"
before there were humans, maybe up to the time of cavemen
Out of interest, where/when was kidnap illegal but muder legal?
Nice
That would be nice...
I dont see why not
Live like it's 2020 baby, it's all just skin.
May i make an illustration of this?
But of course! I forgot thy will be done for all the doms and subs.
He became irrelevant as the world moved on though.
Was that a purposeful cross pun?
Ive just seen that too.

Speaking of being butthurt, whats the betting theyre secretly into roleplay bondage of Jesus getting nailed? I think they call it Thy Kinkdom Cum.

Oh theyre gonna be cross!
Double penetration
My joke was even more disliked than yours
Wow. Ive only just noticed, talk about butthurt! Did I somehow miss a part of the Bible that says God inhabits all disk-based storage media?
Well dont go tying yourself up first or anything!
Hmmm... looks like Freud was right
Didnt realize there were so many easily offended Christians here I thought that was funny
Oh come on that was funny guys
They know it's all in your head.
That has a term, procrasturbation
Neither does communism.
Hes probably wearing the eyepatch on the wrong eye.
Even if it felt like someone else, at best, it'd make one gay, right?
With that attitude youll never know   *&lt;(;-{&gt;
But then it wouldnt feel like someone else
Practice makes perfect.
Doing it very badly though
Really? I don't think so. It feels like I'm doing it and I'm not feeling it. Maybe, we have some sorta special connection with our go-to hand.
Pro tip:   If you use your other hand, itll feel like someone else is doing it.
Then you are fucking yourself by fucking yourself
Read "Floppy dicks"
What if I'm using masturbation AS procrastination? Like "I really should clean my room, but, you know, boner. *knocks on wood* Gotta deal with that."
I did nazi this coming.
I always knew I had a dark sense of humor
that's the homegrown version, there's also gentile jitsu
Would that make them amateur pro-lifers?
One day, floppy disks too, will rise again

Of course. Unless the cow was slaughtered while you were airborne!

Air BnB= Air Buns and Beef
There's even enough levity to carry stowaways.
I have no relevant contribution to this pun thread
It still has some wings left.
Wow Just wow
If it tastes like dirt... Yes
It's been 6 hours. Looks like it took a nosedive.
I'd say it's still ground beef if you had a beef with the crew before boarding the plane, and it continues after taking off
This joke is off the leash.
I think this joke will take off
Thats plane silly

I used to own this t-shirt. Fail.
Airborne beef

I agree. Why do we not teach tactics, and basic weapon skills in schools?
Its was always so negative.
It was in the way she moves
Thanks for the explanation.   

That's an aweful lot of assumptions  about enclosed rooms and OP being a homicidal maniac that I wouldn't have made on my own.
if there is a room filled with 100% of any gas (except oxygen i guess), the people inside will die, and the people outside the door will be laughing

Oh so you *British* British.

Read the sub rules. It actually just says a one liner is one that fits entirely in the title. It makes no mention of actually being one sentence.
I broke my finger last week but on the other hand, I'm okay.
One. Liner.

"Mirror, mirror on the wall, whos the fairest of them all" rings no bells?
It means both pretty and light skinned
"if there were a way to reason with religious people, there would be no more religious people"
Good ol hedberg
Yeah, right? I was surprised of the dictionary saying 'pretty'. Always heard it in the context of light skinned
It does mean light skinned. As far as I know it doesn't mean pretty?
I laughed, its ok
Sounds like a unenlightened umbrella statement
Not a native speaker but 'fair' also means 'pretty' (until now I thought it meant 'light skinned'), so to be pretty op needs to stay out of the sun to not be too tanned (?)
Yore? Yiuar? Eeore? Yioar?
Also,  would probably need an elfthalmologist if there was something wrong with his elves' eyes...

Well, then people wouldn't need to bleach where the sun never shines, to be fair...

Obviously not, just thought I'd share my favourite as I've seen many "non-orignals" here
Haha
Come on, really? I hope you're not trying to use this as an original one liner.
Surely you can agree that whatever one side of you agrees on the other will disagree?
Kit Kat
I'm waiting for the moment they hack accounts to change our comments.
I didn't even laugh either....    Maybe they should restructure it?
Thats pretty long for a oneliner.
I thought I was indecisive, but now Im not sure.
9 weeks = 9 * 7 days = 63 days

Have an upvote for the pun from a former hospital blood banker. Also, there is no practical need for anyone to know their own blood type, no blood baker would ever take your word for it, they'd do the typing themselves.
I prefer it phrased this way.

A man showed up to his psychiatrist appointment only wearing saran wrap. The psychiatrist said "Well, I can clearly see your nuts."
Brilliant.
I'm guessing it's a pun on "Christmas tree"?

Well... its really not as funny as your coworker makes it out to be. Its just a small amount of clever but heres the joke: micro(small) waves(of water). The joke is microwaves and micro waves having two different meanings. Its a play on words. Small waves would be what washes up onto small beaches.
Less funny
Micro (small) waves (of water) washing up on tiny beaches.
Microwaves as in micro(small)waves(of water) tend to wash up (arrive/crash into) tiny beaches. Its a play on micro and waves having a different meanings when together and when apart.

Someone posted it a year before you, too. And I thought I was in the clear originally, but nothing popped up because I typed 'multiple personalities' instead of 'split personality'. I just typed in 'being frank', and that's how I finally found yours and the other one.

Any man who seeks the lord will find him, and can have a connection with him! If youve read my previous comments thoroughly youd have seen that in my view the Bible is not the complete and total doctrine of the Laird but more of a book written about him.

Telling me to prove the existence of dinosaurs without fossils is like me telling you to prove the existence of a higher power without the Bible (which is pretty much how Catholics exits anyways). But Ill play along. There have been numerous accounts of clothing from ancient civilizations found that bear the image of dinosaurs. If the people that made that clothing hadnt seen an actual dinosaur, how would they have known what they look like? People from ancient civilizations wouldnt have known to look for a whole skeleton if they found a fossilized dinosaur bone (which is unlikely) so theres no way they just guessed. People have seen dinosaurs
My nickname was big meater

In Canada the government calls it big meter but everyone else calls it big foot.

It youd have taken the time to read the rules to the sub, youd know that posts have to be one liners. I wasnt correcting their grammar, I was calling them out for not following the rules. And if we want to talk about past comments, at least Im not ignorant enough to actually believe that dinosaurs didnt exist. Or ignorant enough to tell the whole internet I believe that. And to call yourself a Christian in the same breath. Yikes
"CongratZ" ;)
And vice versa
Im not who came here to call someone out on there grammar. I dont really care. The fact that you called someone out for not using periods correctly and then failed to do so yourself is hypocritical. I only called you out, because you called them out. I hope you like the view for your glass house buddy!
Did it again now and got 24,600,000. Hmmmmmm....
23,700,000 for me. Hm..
Slurringly you jest
I think it's congradjulayshuns
You didnt use a period to end your sentence that time, either. If anyones a hypocrite, its you.
Alcoholics go to meetings, drunks don't
Carlin. Great bit.

Brutus rocks
You just need a spark of creativity.

To be fair, it could just as well be a one liner. It's technically not one but we're just being nitpicky here.

&gt; Someone asked me what my occupation was and I said I never got that far because I was always pre-occupied.

In my opinion, it respects the spirit of the rules but not the letter of it.
Im no good with puns, smolder people might be though.
Ah, now I'm all fired up looking for the next pun
And humans.
No butts about it
I Google LSD and got thousands of hits.
Hey, where there's smoke, there's , gotta keep an eye out
Pretty funny.
Stop trying to spark an argument
I want to buy a watch, but I dont have the time.
Wheres the rest of the one liner? Lol.
how to get cigarette lighter? smoke it, should be lighter then
gotta check 'em all to ensure I get the best

/u/thesimpleartist

Do you your fucking unpaid job.
I shouldve used a comma.
Well, thank you!
Two lines......
This is a one-liner I would upvote
Snolem?
Sorry about it not being a one-liner! I got carried away in the writing and forgot the obvious.
What?
Hate to be that guy, but its menstruation, not abortion. Impregnated eggs are not used for omelette.
Not always
Said the chimpanzee to the gorilla
Ah, in that case it works regardless of them being lesbian or not! But it doesn't work because it's not a one liner.
I'll fix it for you:
I never had an occupation because I was always pre-occupied.
For some people, a period starts their adulthood, which may be a sentence on its own...
Neither did you, genius.
So sue me.  Does that count?
Not really a one liner.
It was called "silent but deadly"
Boi thats a two liner.
Id prefer someone like Bernie or Romney. Im not party specific. Registered Democrat but have voted for either over the years. Country over party, everytime.

But I would literally vote for ANYONE other then trump, and have donated small amounts to Bernie and Amash
Well, who do you support?
Dude are you serious...cuz you didnt end your sentence with a period
Dubya was bad.
Trump is an open sewer pit of skull fuckery. I'm not sure exactly what kind of knuckle dragging mouth breather it takes to support a man like this. He is the perfect example of every bad American stereotype from trust fund baby to misogynistic racist hiding behind a Bible he has never once read all compressed down into a five foot ten inch three hundred  thirty pound vanity ridden slob.
Because orange man bad?
Yall really dont get grammar do you? A period ends a sentence
Better joke:

 Trump supporters.
Youre good.
And the Hungry Man's idea of a man from Hungary.
not a one liner but ok
Dad?
I know i fucked up.. I just reposted it
Dinah *in* Maine, I think.
If you don't know Maine, im sorry.
https://youtu.be/sJI878oiBfw?t=34
This "joke" is a 4chan-user's idea of a declaration of war, a conservative's idea of a personal attack, and a moron's idea of a joke. And no one cares what either of us has to say unless it's an actual one-liner, so get the hell out of here.
Ok u/BurnTrumperz
Cheers. I think Ill choose Lets get quizzical.
Well of course it is. Its a fucking great song. 

Its also the sort of song, kind of like *Dust In The Wind,* that people like my dad will silently nod along to, and then when its over, tell anyone who will listen to them, that if they want to know what life is *really* about, them they need to go no further than the great and deep philosophical wisdom imparted by Kenny Rogers and Kansas. 

No. Fantastic songs, though. Top notch.
The song is still good though
Fuckin liberals
Alright now that makes more sense
That's not funny - pedophiles are fucking immature assholes
And american man's idea of a president.
They mean Trump is how a poor man thinks a rich man should behave.
This is a joke in the same way that *The Gambler*, by Kenny Rogers is deep, or philosophical. In that it kinda sounds like it might be, but not really, if you know what jokes or philosophy are. 

If someone like John Oliver or Lewis Black were to deliver the line as part of the build up to the punchline, it could possibly be kinda funny. But on its own, it falls flat.
Do another one!
trump.
I dont think anyone sees trust fund baby trump as a working man, lol.
He's the ladies' man's idea of a men's lady and the Scatman's idea of a man's cat.
hey mods, maybe try removing this? I thought this was just another shitty r/showerthought

Imagine having your head so far up your ass you think everyone in this sub is #1 In America, #2 Agrees with you, and most importantly #3 Wants to see a political opinion that is no way shape or form a one liner joke. Go shill somewhere else.
I heard this to the tune of "Twister"
Dang you've had a reddit account for over half your life then
This is a personal opinion, not a one liner. Get this crap out of here

A super rich man who has to constantly borrow money from Deutsche Bank since no other banks will lend to him, not to mention all the emoluments violations and countless other ways he's trying to profit from his  position.  But yeah, he's totally a billionaire because he says he is and he's never lied before.
He's the black man's idea of a white man, the gay man's idea of a straight man, and the lazy man's idea of a working man.
Bro ok but he's literally a billionaire. There's nobody on Earth who doesn't think hes rich, except for the even richer.
Fuck you. Take my upvote.

I hope they noel all the answers.
Lol thanks.
I hope they look forward to the quizmas song round.
Doesn't work, they could be lesbians.
Then in the office, then on the shop floor, then the police get called...
This is pretty good
Two lines, definitely sick.
There is nothing else to talk about...I'm staying on the subject of defending the joke. Your the one who is trying to deviate from the subject and now trying to make look bad. At this point I dont understand why your so focused on letting people know your opinion. And I'm going to say this again just because your humor differs and it's not funny to yourself, you dont have to say its not funny. As I'm doing  now. I feel that your opinion was a bit much. If you want to be a sour puss go ahead. I'm not gonna stop you I'm just gonna continue to add my comments and hopefully annoy you some more. I need to pass time anyhow :D. Good day to you aswell!
Uhhh, what? So, you have nothing new or original to add to this conversation so you regurgitate what I wrote and try to project it onto me? 

Wowzers. Enjoy the rest of your day!
"Its not funny at all" is a little harsh for being just a comment. You didn't have to say that. you put yourself out there aswell. If you cant handle my comments maybe reddit isn't for you :P
Did I invade his safe space? He put himself out there. He's getting upvotes. If he's going to be upset over my little comment then maybe Reddit isn't for him.
Just because u dont like it doesn't mean it's bad. No need to slam OP for just trying to make ppl laugh.
It should be on /r/runonliners. It's not funny. At all. 

Rules: Entire joke should be in the title.

There's no joke here.
That's why it's on r/oneliners and not on r/dadjokes...

That's far too specific for this joke.
No April foolin'. On April 1, 1994, the Texas Rangers celebrated the opening of Globe Life Park in Arlington. The  facility serves as the centerpiece of a 270-acre complex in  Arlington, Texas. The 48,114-seat open-air complex also includes a four-story office building within the ballpark, a 12-acre lake, and parks and recreation space on the perimeter. Total cost of the project was approximately $191 million.

You cheked /r/jokes and didnt find it but both of us saw it there before you posted it, and your friend may have seen  it on /r/jokes too
No, you didn't. I saw it like 3 days ago on r/jokes. You're here for the karma grab. Give it up.
Actually, he is.  I heard the joke from a friend.  I checked /r/jokes before posting, didn't see it.  So he's wrong on both statements.
Hes not tho
You are incorrect.
stolen from r/jokes, too lazy to give credit.

Wow.

I never said I didn't know, I just didn't think about it when I posted this. And you are the only one getting fanny troubled because you have let a simple repost fill you with so much ire that you are taking time out of your day to attempt to chastise me over it.
Dont get but hurt because you got called out on your karma whoring, but yeah way to insult my intelligence after reposting the top post of all time and then trying to pull it off like you didnt know.
I never said I made it up dingus, I said I remembered it. Your reading comprehension is lacking, my G.

Or is it that there was a curse in German mythology. The old gods were displeased with humanity as a whole for neglecting them and abandoning them when they were week and no longer had a mortal life to give their existence a meaning. As punishment, they ensured that one of the greatest desires humans have is sex, something the gods punished them for, even though it was essential for their continued existence. However, they witnessed what true desire meant. People started to fornicate extremely young girls to mask their deeds under layers of fear, preventing them from ever confessing to the gods. Horrified and guilted, they ensured that all the innocent German girls would be yelling their age out to ensure that no misdeeds would ever stay hidden from the people, the humans, whose punishment was far greater than those endowed by the gods, since only a creature who knows true physical, mental and emotional pain can be worthy of those who deserve the harshest.

Atheist? Do you now everyone there is to know?

- No, not possible.

Is it possible that God could exist outside your body of knowledge?

- Yes, I guess that could be true.

Oh, that's okay. Then you're not an atheist you're an agnostic, a doubter.

- You're right, that makes sense.

So here's another question. Because a doubter can honestly try to discover the truth or just believe what he believes and not be open to truth. So are you an honest or dishonest doubter?

- I'd like to think I'm honest.

Great, I trust you'll find the truth, wherever it is.

I get that in order to make the joke work, the ah needs to be silent, but that doesnt change the fact that Keanu backwards does not sound the same as unique.

To rehash what other people have said, its like the old joke that Jesus backwards is sausage; sure, if you squint at it and apply some creative liberties, it works, but it doesnt change the fact that Jesus backwards is not sausage.

I guess what Im saying is, the logical stretch needed to make the joke work kills the joke slightly.

Which, in fact, would make this joke AMAZING for  /r/3amjokes, so maybe try posting it there? Its definitely the kind of thing thats jaw bustingly hilarious at 3 am
This is plain lazy. Shame on your mother!
The ah is silent when pronounced backwards.
ale le beta.. abhi tak yahi ho? jao bahar jao.. bachhe bazi krne jao.. bhul gaye abbu ne kya bola tha? bachha bazi a day keeps jihadis away..
True. To relax more, try picking up near wood rather than firewood.
Camping is a really in tents activity.
Pronunciation of Keanu:

Kee-ah-nu 

Backwards:

Un-ah-eek


Pronunciation of unique:

Un-eek

In short, Not the same
Are you Australian? That is the only accent that come close to working with this.
Help me out here mr/mrs.  backwards word scholar!
Its an older, unique pronounciation, but it checks out
\*stationery
mast joke, jaa apni maaa ko suna, goddamn randians spreading like cockroaches
This joke is incorrect, it's pronounced u-na-ek, which doesn't sound like unique at all
Oop nevermind .. some guy got there before me
Saying Jesus backward is sausage
Oonaique?
reachin there
So Keanu is the opposite of unique or is unique the opposite of Keanu?
KEE-new
How do your parents pronounce it? 

I feel like this is just a "Jesus backwards sounds like sausage" type thing
My parents are convinced it's pronounced like that. Annoys the hell out of me.

Eh, the wording kills the joke itself. It'd be better if you just left out the word off but only slightly. The whole things a bit too wordy to have the impact of a good one liner.

Not that its irrelevant. It falls in line with the standard for one liners, however its not your average one. I personally dont even think its funny 
Remains can be seen
You don't understand one liner humor, do you?
Are you high?
But all these one liners have a line that then leads up to something relevant to it. Ah fuck it. Humour is subjective. My downvotes are... inevitable.
Its an ironic statement. Irony is something that is the opposite of whats expected. Irony is a form of humor. Hence, that was the point.
But the joke wouldn't make sense
Thats the point
Wait but it's an oxymoron. Doesn't make sense...
The opposite of "in" is "out"

Strange thing though by the end of the Summer my posture improved and my parents couldn't figure out why.

Not true. I believe abortion is murder and in that case murder is ok.
People who believe in abortion do not admit to any continuity between the unborn person and yourself.

I think you can get away with it here since the context tells me it's a joke but really you are just stating that you were going to have a 5-way and 2 people didn't show up so you just had a 3way instead. I have it a 4/10.
I hate to be that guy who corrects grammar, but this specific one is one of my pet peeves.

It should be despite, not in spite of.

Despite is used when you did something even though something did or didn't happen.

In spite of is used when you do something because of something happening or not happening (for spite)

&amp;#x200B;

Cause I'm pretty sure one does not need to have tourettes to speak like this on a regular basis.

&amp;#x200B;

All jokes aside I have a friend with severe tourettes. It's really bad. Like...... really bad. He's got the tics and spasms and everything. Only instead of curse words? He screams about fruit and no I am not joking or being a troll. He also happens to be one of the most talented musicians I've ever had the pleasure of jamming with. He's got a good mindset concerning his condition but there is nothing more unsettling than hearing someone scream about crab apples and persimmon at 4 in the morning while you're trying to take a nap in the loft of an unfamiliar recording studio in between sessions. 

&amp;#x200B;

TBH his outbursts have often been the inspiration for my grocery store visits. His tics..... the vocal outbursts? Sometimes the fruit names he screams? He's never even heard of. Like gooseberries for instance. It's one of his most common outbursts. Gooseberries are an actual thing. He didn't know it and I just recently found actual gooseberries in my local grocery store. They are orange. Look like super tiny orange tomatoes on the vine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Look I know it's fucked up but he is clearly tapped into something the rest of us are not. He screams about fruit? I look up the fruit, if it exists? YEAH. I FUCKING BUY IT AND TRY IT OUT.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're a healthy human AND follow practices to preserve your anatomy then... It's very well possible for it to retract back to its original shape, tight even. In an ideal scenario hormones mostly would control the expansion of the vagina in childbirth, so when their effects end, it is very likely.

However this world is less than ideal, so rather than she risk it, it's a better idea to have a c-section.
I do have this one friend who demanded c-sections to "preserve" that particular part of her anatomy.

Or is it because you have sexdaily?
It took me a minute but it finally clicked that OP wrote felt instead of left.

8.7328917413 is the third root of evil.
Well luckily I linked where I got the numbers from. But in short China and Japan, Italy, and Afghanistan respectively.
Ive never heard of 9, 17 or 39 as evil numbers, what cultures are they from?
No its not, every positive number has both a positive and a negative real square root. 


4 = 2 *and* -2


Imaginary numbers are the roots of negative numbers, not the negative roots of numbers.
&gt;If the number 666 is evil then 25.80669759011 is the root of **ALL** evil.

There is a logical mistake here you added all.

According to [national geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/9/130913-friday-luck-lucky-superstition-13/) the other evil numbers that exist are: **4 9 13 17 39**

So 748 is the sum of all fears.

Then 27.3495886624 is the root of ALL evil.
That's just imaginary evil
Women are the product of time and money, therefore
Women = Time x Money

But, time is money, so
Women = Money x Money
Women = Money2

We know money is the root of all evil, thus
Money =Evil
Women = (Evil)2

Therefore:
Women = Evil

Who cares? Show me where OP claimed they wrote it
What joke?
I'm pretty sure it's common knowledge that the majority of the joke you hear and read are not originals.
Just saying OP didn't create it
Never hear of him and would have never heard the joke with out it being posted here.

Who?
I prefer the original one

You wanna know what I cant stand? Never mind, I dont have a leg to stand on.
I'm on morphine, I'm happy to wait to heal up LOL
Haha, nah man. I think I just made the implication a bit too much of a stretch. Always the tough thing with jokes, make it too obvious and it's not funny, make it take too long to realize and people don't get it at all.

I hope you heal up ok and enjoy the high in the mean time.
It's possibly just me, I'm on ***VERY*** strong pain control medication at the moment LOL
Don't forget the round glasses
Yup, that was the joke I was making. I guess people didn't really get it.

I don't think the amount of people who know what the Hogwarts sorting hat is but won't recognize it from just "Sorting hat" is very big
Because every human will understand Harry Potter references, right?
A lot of people probably wouldn't get the sort g hat right away. By saying Hogwarts it gives some reference so the joke can be understood quicker.
Thanks!!
Love it.

You can drop Hogwarts, and capitalize Sorting Hat for a cleaner joke;-)

There was a part where the vampires played baseball at night during a storm.  It was entertaining.
Sounds like when I was forced to read Harry Potter Fine, if you read it growing up you probably will love it forever, but reading it for the first time as an adult, it's just a very average kids book. Nothing special about it at all.

&gt; there was literally one part where it was fun for about ten pages

I can only assume it was a printing error?
Get the

Allright?
Couple coworkers went on about how great it was.  I told them it wicked, writing was terrible, story sounded cliche as hell.  They told me I couldnt judge it unless I read it.

Fine.

I read the whole thing, and there was literally one part where it was fun for about ten pages, around 270 pages in...  then it sucked again.

I was then told that I just didnt understand it.  Whatever.  I understand that the prose is about as complex as an eleven year olds love notes.

Compare that to the opening paragraph of Snow Crash:

&gt;The Deliverator belongs to an elite order, a hallowed subcategory. He ' s got esprit up to here. Right now, he is preparing to carry out his third mission of the night. His uniform is black as activated charcoal, filtering the very light out of the air. A bullet will bounce off its arachnofiber weave like a wren
hitting a patio door, but excess perspiration wafts through it like a breeze through a freshly napalmed forest, Where his body has bony extremities, the suit has sintered armorgel: feels like gritty jello, protects like a stack of telephone books.

See, the story of Snow Crash feels like a B movie in book form with all sorts of terrible decisions, though pretty obviously tongue-in-cheek.  But the prose phenomenal.
Apart from the women, they claim they are ten years younger.

**Coke (fuel)**

Coke is a grey, hard, and porous fuel with a high carbon content and few impurities, made by heating coal or oil in the absence of air  a destructive distillation process.  It is an important industrial product, used mainly in iron ore smelting, but also as a fuel in stoves and forges when air pollution is a concern.

The unqualified term "coke" usually refers to the product derived from low-ash and low-sulfur bituminous coal by a process called coking. A similar product called petroleum coke, or pet coke, is obtained from crude oil in oil refineries.

This joke is so old, I found it in my granddads diary. It had an annotation that said: "don't tell, very worn out".
I'm sure this phrase is derived from a popular New York soup vendor, whose street stall was often thronged with customers  whom he kept firmly in line with a loud German accent, prompting his nickname, 'The Soup Nazi'.

Though, in that case the purpose is not to get rid of partiality but to counter one partiality with another hoping that it cancels out somehow.    
And this is not necessarily a bad thing, since e. g. men and women have different tasks in child rearing (mothers _are_ the primary care givers, the first person a newborn connects to, while fathers introduce children to the world, challenge them to grow).

I named my eraser ignorance for the same reason.

Yeah, these supposedly equalizing measures (as in a trade-off) as well as affirmative action (or do you think that is unrelated?) are not long-term solutions, if they are solutions at all.
Think about it in terms of let's say Women Equality/ Empowerment. Women were supposed to be of lower class than men in earlier centuries. With education this thought was started to being questioned and asked for improvement in their conditions. Now the society/civilisation gave them special/veto powers over some situations. Now that might not be wrong in short term situations but offering these Powers in long term is just another form of partialty. In this case, now men are being supressed by those powers that society offered to women. And by supressed I mean like, lack of equal say in Justice/laws, partial laws for women claiming false rights.

Rather what should be done is try to improve the conditions of supressed like for example by providing better education and values. That's what a long term solution looks like!
Wait, does civilisation bring about partiality to demolish partialty or partialty to demolish partiality?

It's not an actual grammatical rule.  I read somewhere that it was a rule in Latin that's been carried over by some finicky linguists.

A good riff on this that I have heard attributed to Churchill:

The ending of a sentence with a preposition is something up with which I will not put.
The little guy must have been heading to his spin class
Honestly, I kind of feel like this shouldn't be a rule anymore. Language has evolved so much over time that it can be difficult to avoid ending with a preposition. Certain common phrases even make it impossible because the phrase ends with a preposition. Using correct grammar just sounds terrible now because that just isn't how we talk anymore. Now, I'm not advocating for a complete dismissal of grammar; just the preposition rule.

Oh my God! When is the last time one of y'all has been laid?
Okay, Merriam Webster's definition of a one-liner joke
1. A very succinct joke or wittisism.
2.  A succinct or meaningful or especially accurate statement.

Ius not about how many sentences it's about how ya tell it. Don Rickles, Groucho Marks, Rodney Dangerfield, all one liner kings I guarantee not even 10 percent of their one liners only had one sentence. The key here is succinct! It's gotta be short and shot from the hip. Oh, and you guys are the only one Tryon to be stickers for the rules. What happens if there is 2 sentences and the rules are broken? Does anyone lose money? Does someone go to Reddit prison? Does Carrot top get his own late-night show? Well. If the Carrot top thing happens then I get it. Only one sentence from now on y'all.

And this concludes the first class of Comedy 101.
Im not saying I agree with the rules of this sub, but most people do.
I hope you never teach comedy
Yes, but it has three periods, and therefor, three lines. Its not what everybody else thinks, its what the rules of this subreddit are.
Omg. I'm an idiot. Thanks for pointing out my mistakes
How is this a joke?
Ha, agreed
Thats like telling somebody that lives in a single bedroom house to buy a bigger house even though they dont need it. And yes, its two lines. Two periods = two lines (every sentence equals a line.)

It has nothing to do with screen size.
Okay then, leave me a stupid redditor. See if I care xd

He could have used the word *"because"* to make it a oneliner?


What the fuck is wrong with some people, read the sentence ffs
Hmmm... 

Did not know that one line equals one sentence but ok...
Periods end sentences and if theres another word after that it becomes two.
It is one line if you are on from PC unless your screen is small, then buy a bigger screen...
Damn. What kind?
Ha, good one
How else to you plot a graph?
He didn't say Because
He didn't use a comma

My tinnitus comes and goes. Some days I can easily tune it out. Other days, I just can't turn it down. That usually happens when I under stress.
Sorry to hear that. (No pun intended... Maybe)

I think everyone with tinnitus suffers with different severity, to be honest.
I was just being dramatic. I have tinnitus and am only able to ignore it when theres a lot of background noise to drown it out. I typed that when I had just woken up and it was the only thing I could hear .
Nor does it necessarily do that... Most people who suffer it just learn to live with it and others would never know/notice unless told by them.
Just slowly drive you to the brink of insanity
Tinnitus doesn't necessarily cause you to shout or much impair your hearing.

The One Where Chandler Can't Cry
I once mixed up my laxatives with my viagra - talk about being shit at sex
I did this when checking into an industry sponsored happy hour event.  The woman checking my wife and myself in, asked if she's seen me somewhere.  Immediately and without thinking about it I responded: "Do you watch porn? You might know me from there".   Little did I know, my buddy was right behind me and heard this.  After we walked away, he said to her, "Do you know who that is?!" and spread his hands apart like he was describing the size of a fish he caught.   

I found out a few minutes later what he had done.  The entire night, she kept bringing various women over to a neighboring table, whisper in their ear while looking in my general direction.  My wife was a great sport. I caught her a couple times making eye contact with these women, doing a slight nod and giving them a wink.
Can the last word be safely replaced with any other infrastructure, or is the joke that the fetishist keeps coming?
Are you eighteen yet?

Dont down vote me, I just say dumb shit to make myself laugh.
A line and a sentence are not the same thing. A line is the shortest path from point A to point B. A  sentence is defined by grammar and punctuation. Making a joke in a concise way (point A to point B) is a line.

Wouldn't say I'm really taking it seriously. I totally agree with you that it's about style and delivery above everything else. This joke does not have the style and delivery of a one liner unfortunately. 

Again, I still think it's a good joke.
They remove your shorts
Yeah, you're taking it way too serious. One liners are usually one sentence long, not always. It's more about the style and delivery of the joke. Lighten up, it's comedy not communism.
Good joke but there are two lines: set up-&gt;punchline. It is not a one liner
Would use of a comma or semicolon ruin it?

OP took the letters from Argentina, rearranged them (I took them and crossed out which ones I used to form the new word). In the end, they needed an E for tangerine but only had an A left over. So they almost found the letters of the word Tangerine in the word Argentina, but not entirely.

It's literally a true one. Child labor is common practice in China. I think the word that popped up in your brain is 'racism', but cultural practices have nothing to do with race.
ah. I remember it from one of those old "internet joke books" that somehow existed in the 90s.
Pretty sure that joke is from one of his books. Check him out

Uh... But this aint a popular stereotype i believe...
Child labour

That's my only guess that makes this line funny!

So you don't do things that need licenses, but they're a big enough hassle in your life, that you thought someone would relate to the joke you posted?
I try to stay away from things that require licenses. And I'm a software contractor which is technically a business though I dont have a public office.
&gt;business should happen everywhere all the time unexpectedly like you pay someone to mow your grass, or 2 people pass eachother on the sidewalk and one sells the other 2 cigarettes for a dollar

I mean, if you don't understand the difference between those scenarios and an actual business, you have no *business* running one. 

No wonder you hate them so much; you've probably been dramatically underqualified for most of the oddly numerous licenses you've applied for.
business should happen everywhere all the time unexpectedly like you pay someone to mow your grass, or 2 people pass eachother on the sidewalk and one sells the other 2 cigarettes for a dollar
&gt;we should make it easier to start a business

It's pretty easy, I think. If getting the necessary licenses to run a business is the thing keeping you from doing it, maybe you weren't meant to run a business.

So you just want to buldoze and run liquor stores without any kind of oversight? Is that what this is joke is about? I don't think that's all gonna fit in one line, man.
&gt;  You're talkin' tightly-regulated, age-restricted product that needs to be responsibly managed. A license should be the bare minimum of requirements to sell it 

Giving or selling alcohol to minors is already a crime. A license is just extra work.

&gt;Not to mention we're wandering into small business territory,  

we should make it easier to start a business

&gt;Who invites someone to a party, then charges for drinks?

fraternities near a college
&gt;A more common problem is license to sell alcohol at a party at your house

Are we just listing reasonable things that should require special permissions to perform? 

You're talkin'  tightly-regulated, age-restricted product that needs to be responsibly managed. A license should be the bare minimum of requirements to sell it. Not to mention we're wandering into small business territory, here. Damn right you need a license. 

Also, you're doing parties wrong if you're charging for drinks. Who invites someone to a party, then charges for drinks? That's the real joke, here.

I could do more damage with a toothpick than most people could do with a bulldozer. Maybe now we should have toothpick licenses.
To bad he won't find what he's looking for...
&gt;a guy rented a small bulldozer to flatten a driveway and had to get a license to drive it on private property.

Large, destructive equipment that could be dangerous in the wrong hands? I mean, it seems fair. 

Also, not a terribly common problem, honestly.
everywhere and often, like a guy rented a small bulldozer to flatten a driveway and had to get a license to drive it on private property. You need a license to do almost anything
...okay. 

Is there undue licensing going around or something? What's the joke?
&gt;Why would I need a license to use the bathroom?

to make sure you know how to not pee on the seat
What's the joke, here? Is the government expanding? Why would I need a license to use the bathroom? What precedent is this joke based on?

I'm pissed off at charter internet for wasting my time they sent me a paper offering $45 for internet and tv, which is less than I'm already paying for internet, and in tiny letters I later see "each" so its $90, which I found out 5 minutes into the call. So I merged that with the "2 for the price of 1" seen in common ads.

Exactly.  So inserting the obviously false statement about being always right takes away from that fun play on words.
The joke is that hes saying he was wrong once and then contradicting that statement by saying he was mistaken about being wrong.

If you were once mistaken, then you weren't right, which contradicts the opening statement.  "I'm never wrong" works, though.
Hi Miss Taken.
That's the joke.
You mean chips per bag
But if you were mistaken then you were wrong about thinking you were right, that means you were actually wrong on that one.
Yeah sounds weird how it is worded.  I've always said "I've never been wrong, except for that one time I thought I was wrong but turned out I was right."
Getting rid of the first sentence makes it a one liner and still works.  Been saying this one for 30 years now.

Yes, you could buy a house and support a family... but your house had two bedrooms and one bathroom for the whole family to share, the family also shared one car and one television between them and certainly no computers, entertainment that came free to air was all the entertainment you needed, takeout food was a once-a-month luxury if you were lucky, you had to work late nights and weekends if you wanted any hope of ever sending your kids to college, and there were plenty of jobs to go round because women stayed home with the children.

Millennials could easily return to the economy that baby boomers lived in, if they were willing to live under the same conditions...
Step right up!
If I had a dollar for every time millennials blamed baby boomers for not giving them an easy world to live in, I would have enough money to provide all of them with history lessons to demonstrate how much freer and more comfortable their world is than it has been for any generation thats gone before them.
Brother in law has a bachelor's in computer science, 1 year after graduation and he still can't find a job.
Eh... boomers are too young to blame for that.
The economy is awesome, but the wages have been stale for a long time, doesnt keep up with inflation and cost of living
Something something stale wages... you could buy a house and support a family with the pay wages back in the day, these days 45k is barely livable in many many places
The victimology is strong with this one. It's not what the boomers had that makes the difference, it's what they didn't have to spend their money on. Cell phones, internet, streaming music, video games, expensive coffee, fast food, cable TV, HBO, etc.. 

Add it up, it is a ridiculous drain. The biggest rip-off the new generations face are student loans for worthless degrees that will never make a dime for you. I'm calling you Gender Studies. If you spend money for a degree that can't get you a job, you're an idiot. I have a daughter-in-law with a $60K student loan, she has a Masters in Fine Art, she paints rooms.
Not if they're British and thus colour blind.
Lots of manufacturing here, if you will work shift work many jobs start in the 20 a hour range. 16 an hour is begging for help.
Yeah easy get a job for sure, but the 90% of the jobs that are easy to get don't pay shit
The plans for destroying the economy started in the 60s and were implemented in the Reagan era, so you cant really blame the boomers. You can even blame their parents, there were warnings but the stranglehold on media started about then too.
This economy is awesome, you should have tried getting a job in the 70s

That's the joke?
That is my point! Your joke states that A.) you will commit suicide, or B.) that you will die while trying to commit suicide. They are both the same thing. There is no potential for failure, but there is in reality.
I don't think i'll be able to bear this joke.
Don't mean to sound condescending but there's a difference between attempting and committing suicide. If I shoot myself and don't die, I'd say " Damn! I attempted suicide and failed, I'll try again" :)
Lol yh but my point is you're saying you'll either kill yourself or die trying... But if you shoot yourself in the face and survive then you've not successfully committed suicide and so your conditions are wrong. Decent joke, but you should reword it. God, I sound autistic.
seems reasonable
I'll try again :)

I'm not sure this is how evolution works: I thought it was 'natural selection', in which individuals best suited to an environment would survive and have progeny with a similar feature, so they too would survive, and so a species would evolve.

Hello AntiLowEffortBot!

Listen. You might mean well, but your bot isn't doing much good.

Your efforts are pathetic and your messages are ridiculous.
Besides, people aren't going to stop this because a bot told them to.

Seriously. Please stop.

Everyone gets them. It is just that some still believe in the Great Communist Future to find them funny. But the jokes about the communism, especially from the old Soviet Union can tell you a lot about the people who lived there.
For example:
Six paradoxes of the socialist state:
1. Nobody works, but the plan is always fulfilled. 
2. The plan is fulfilled, but the shelves in the stores are empty. 
3. The shelves are empty, but nobody starves. 
4. Nobody starves, but everybody is unhappy.
5. Everybody is unhappy, but nobody complains. 
6. nobody complains, but the jails are full.

Interesting thing to research.  I love Billy too.  Deep Thoughts  started (according to my two seconds of googling ) in 1984 with the National Lampoon, years before he was on SNL  And Johnny Carson used the line in 1991.  Billy has been active long before that of course, but I acknowledge it could be one of those organic lines that emerge multiple places.   Either way, its a great line.
And already posted on this sub
Think it may have been Billy connelly before that, I always here it in a scottish accent.
oh hush, its still funny
At least it wasnt a shit show!

I first saw this as a bumper sticker. In 1993.
Poor grammar and/or spelling completely ruins the line, however.
There sure are many hateful people, even within the church, and that's inevitable, but it doesn't matter. God is still there and he still loves all, sinner and saint. And thanks for humouring me.
Next time will be Christmas, I come here on Christmas and Easter basically to keep my mother happy. I went every Sunday and Wednesday until I was 16-17. I stopped going because my last time at religious ed  I heard a speaker literally say "God hates fags" talking about how they go to hell for their transgressions against the idea that God made us in his image, and that they don't deserve to be able to exchange their money for goods and services in this world because they deny and defile the natural law of marriage and sex for procreation bla bla bla

But in mass today part of the sermon was about how we should be more welcoming of different cultures, skin colors, and sexual orientations, on top of the intended idea that jesus' resurrection can be similar to a resurrection of faith because Father What's His Name knew he was talking to a lot of people who only come to mass on religious holidays. I can't deny that there is goodness in some of the moralizing, but the amount of near physically violent hatred I've felt directed towards people I know and think very highly of is a very potent deterrent to ever consider coming here regularly. I could probably quadruple what I've already written but I'm going out to lunch with family  now. I know you have good intentions and I figured I'd humor you because there are probably quite a few people here that could share a similar sentiment to my own.
It's sarcastic and I curse my inability to change it every day.

Yeah, so this is just somewhat theoretical, but the vagus nerve which has communication between the brain and all your organs (except the adrenal glands) has portions of it that contain the receptors activated by LSD (not just your brain). You know the butterfly feelings? Vagal stimulation. Your vagus nerve also has functions in your bowels that are also independent of the brain. LSD is a serotonin shape, and 95 of serotonin in your body is produced and found in the gut. This all has a relationship, and would explain trip shits. I actually further theorise that metabolic gut problems related to serotonin, dopamine, not just brain chemistry are the causes of depression, anxiety, and perhaps even schizophrenia.

LSD is a serotonin shape, and 95 of serotonin in your body is produced and found in the gut. This all has a relationship, and would explain trip shits. I actually further theorise that metabolic gut problems related to serotonin, dopamine, not just brain chemistry are the causes of depression, anxiety, and perhaps even schizophrenia.
I apologize in advance.  I know it's cheese, but I just had to.

Itt OP has no idea what acid is like.
If it's not one sentence then it's by definition not a one liner, and there are plenty of other joke subs for them at that point. It's not a crazy concept.
Dropped a pocket.
People should prioritize wording one liners to be funnier or clearer, not to be a sentence.
he'll*
It should, per the definition of a one liner. People should just learn to format and word things properly to fir the bill. That's what I was getting at.
I agree. One-liner shouldnt strictly refer to jokes that are exactly one sentence.
I wont put with with this.

Im lack-toes intolerant.
Haha fuck. Sounds like the best of times and the worst of times.
This isn't how LSD works though
I at some shrooms in college and really wanted to make it down to the river despite it being night in the middle of October.  I made it as far as Main and Harrison (about 5 blocks) before I heard Patton Oswald in my head.

The human rectum is almost nightmarishly elastic

At that point I suddenly had to dump.  Ran home and did my business while Children of the Corn played in the other room.  Tough times.

Undaunted, I cleaned up and started walking again.  Made it to the same intersection when suddenly I heard him all over again.

The human rectum is almost nightmarishly elastic

Had to run back home.  Dumped all over again.  By this time is was when Children of the Corn really goes off the rails at the end and all the screaming from the tv and my two also-tripping roommates reduced me to a sobbing, shitting blob on the toilet.

7/10 would do again.
One time in college I took three hits of acid, and right before it hit I felt the knotted bowel and had 30 seconds to make it to a bathroom. I fucking ran downstairs (me and some bois lived in a two story) went into the bathroom, locked the door, took off all my clothes and just as my asshole was over the toilet (I was almost completely sat down) let out Poseidon's rage. I was holding the walls as the terror relentlessly left my anus. Of course half way through this is when the acid kicks in. So I'm trippin and having the worst shit of my life. Don't know how long it actually took but it felt like 10 minutes at least. After all of the liquid feces left, I cleaned up my poor drained husk of a body. Had a existential crisis once I made it back up to my room that lasted about 2 hours. Ended up watching the Avengers (1st one, fun), Dark City (this is a terrible bad acid trip movie), and L.A. Confidential (just a good movie in general) followed by some episodes of Community. 

Overall not a great experience, but fuck it man I'm alive and not traumatized.

Almost every time I've started peaking, it's been in a bathroom. Have I pooped yet? Do I need to poop? Am I wet? Did I already wipe? Impossible questions.

Mhmm. Yes. My family has Chinese in it (and Maori, Thai, Fijian, Indian), I think that makes my joke ... classical too. Anyhow, this convo is becoming circular, we have things to do. Have a nice day.
But I actually would like that to be reality
In the joke you are referring to, I say Mexican (not a slur) and use a stereotype which is just classical humor. I also wrote that joke after getting my first wife (who is Mexican) pregnant after having sex the first time.
Pun intended.
Is it unreasonable for me to expect everyone to like all of my jokes?
This is boring.
Did you just see that on the AskReddit thread?
&gt;I think OP and others have a different definition of 'upside down' than you.

I agree. I believe that what I consider "upside down" is what you call "reflection", because each letter is flipped 180 degrees so that what used to be the top of the letter is now at the bottom.
This process doesn't change the letter's location in its word, so that the "C" at the beginning of the word (CHOICE), is still in its same spot, at the beginning of the word, after being "flipped" (reflected). See higher in this thread for CHOICE.

This is why I believe a "reflection" is a more accurate way to turn something upside down, because it doesn't also rotate it sideways as well, only up/down.

Which is why I made my first critique in this thread in the first place, because SWIMS doesn't stay SWIMS if it's only reflected. In addition to being "reflected", it must also be changed left to right as well, otherwise the first "W" will still be an "M".

Thanks for the feedback, but I've already spent way too much time thinking and talking about this.

Peace.

I think OP and others have a different definition of 'upside down' than you. The key is that upside down is rotation of 180 degrees, and vertical flip is a reflection. The difference between reflection  and rotation is like this; Imagine you are looking at a puddle and it is showing the reflection of the sky. The reflection of the sky is mirrored in the puddle, but left and right are not going to be reversed. Rotate your phone 180 degrees. It's going to be up side down just like the sky in the puddle but left is now right. 
And I will plan to be spontaneous tomorrow.
Fuck you
Hahahaha
...whoa
So, what's the difference between "vertical flip" and "upside down"?

&gt;CHOICE upside down is like IOH.

No, that's turned backwards horizontally, not flipped upside down vertically.

No yeah upside down SWIMS is still SWIMS. Youre thinking of vertical flip. CHOICE is still CHOICE when its flipped vertically. CHOICE upside down is like IOH.
Rotated 180 degrees would work just as well.
One of my favourite oneliners from the Hellsing abridged series. Felt like I needed to share this hilarious obscenity with the world.

Please excuse me, but I think you mean upside down and backwards, don't you?

The word SWIMS flipped just up/down is actually SMIWS (with the S's backwards), which is why it's also backwards, in addition to being upside down.

But, the word CHOICE just upside down is still CHOICE.

Hey BooCMB, just a quick heads up:
I learnt quite a lot from the bot. Though it's mnemonics are useless,
and 'one lot' is it's most useful one, it's just here to help. This is like screaming at
someone for trying to rescue kittens, because they annoyed you while doing that. (But really CMB get some quiality mnemonics)

I do agree with your idea of holding reddit for hostage by spambots though, while it might be a bit ineffective.

Have a nice day!
Hey /u/CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up:  
Your spelling hints are really shitty because they're all essentially "remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word".

I learned it as c, and I found it made the conceptual transition to quadratic equations, since c is generally the term all by itself, rather than multiplying an x or x^2
No worries! It makes more sense now. Dont forget to edit your other comment in the thread!
Strange. I saw the page I linked had used _b_ but never realized it was a regional difference. I think _c_ is predominantly used here as it's just some **c**onstant, but I guess the letter choice doesn't matter. I also just looked up why we use _m_ for gradient - turns out [nobody knows](https://services.math.duke.edu/education/webfeats/Slope/Slopederiv.html).

In statistics, the "mean" value is the average value. Some of us cannot turn down a chance to throw a pun into any discussion
Why?
That was a mean thing to say.
Heard a similar joke, but there's a build up.

I man goes to a funeral for someone he barely knew. He sees a woman crying in the front row. He walks up and asks "May I say a word?" The woman allows it. The man goes up to the lecture, takes a deep breath, and says "Many." The man stepped down from the lecture, and the woman said "Thanks. That meant a lot."
A mathematician with constipation must work it out with a pencil. 
ghost of the food doing reverse anal
Is the "many" joke original. Unlike most puns, this one is funny.
I heard that on a commercial today, can't for the life of me remember for what. 
This is funny and sad - perfectly balanced, as all things should be. 
Im fucked both ways.

True, but if you got it I think it would have qualified for some facetious humor ;-) Then again, at least now I've learned something.
That is really interesting! But isnt this a subreddit for jokes?

OP means using old men as the pieces in chess (I.e. King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Pawn).
There are people that actually do this in real life!
Christiaans wont be happy with you
Another LARPer I see.
As is use 32 men as the pieces moving them around....hehhehehehhe
I don't get it
We all gonna dice two days
It's an English joke.  If I'm talking about the "number 6", I pronounce the "b", but if I say my left hand is number (more numb) than my right hand, I wouldn't pronounce the "b" (I'd just say "nummer"- actually, I'd probably say "more numb", but "nummer" works, too, especially for this joke.)  FYI this joke doesn't really work if you say it- it only works in written form.
Thank fuck I'm a virgin
We all gonna die one day
Non native English speaker here. Is 'number' the superlative of 'numb'?
No I get the math part if it I just didnt know if it was also an English joke as well
Number as in the number 6
Is this supposed to also be an English pun because technically number is not the grammatically way to say more numb or am I just overthinking it

Ok if its not based on reality can you tell me specifically what is false within it?

I hate when I get grilled for sitting in traffic
It's a delusional thought because it's not based on reality. This world-view is fake af. Your myopic lens does not see the whole of humanity through the whole of history. Life is far more vast and nuanced than one ideology will ever encompass.
True, it may not be preventable with our current systems in place, but its not a viewpoint its an observable reality.  
&gt; we are living in a world now that is profitable to feed off of peoples confirmation biases and people with that interest in mind are happy to promise us a lie if it benefits them.

This is the kind of world view you come from that may not either be true or preventable. 
What are you talking about verbal verbosity, everything said in this was using very simple easy to digest language that everybody should know. Im not using big words or being showy, Im expressing what I see happening here in objective reality and expressing it in a way anybody can understand. I just happen to use rhyme and rhythm in my way of communicating. I dont understand how youre seeing arrogance in this while youre literally spitting insults at me with my arrogant boyish nature. You say this is horse hockey and makes no sense, well what exactly doesnt make sense to you? I did ask for specifics. Of course we need CO2 in our atmosphere, its part of the ecosystem but too much of anything is a bad thing. Even h2o can kill us with a high enough volume of it. Where on earth are you getting your data from that claims CO2 is decreasing? Dont you see that like I mentioned, we are living in a world now that is profitable to feed off of peoples confirmation biases and people with that interest in mind are happy to promise us a lie if it benefits them.  There is an article out there for everyone but you cant just pick the ones you like youve got to look at the rest of the world around you and piece the puzzle together. 
It's always exhausting
Hey listen, Dr. Seuss, you're boyish balancing act of verbal verbosity only screams arrogance and not authority. Those ramblings of yours are pure horse hockey and make no sense whatsoever. You need to back up your thoughts with fact-based evidence. The fact is that CO2 is a miracle molecule and life would cease to exist without it. The planet is at historic lows and plants are starving for more CO2. Burning fossil fuels *improves the planet* not destroying it. Fossil fuel energy is the Golden Goose that is laying golden eggs for both the planet and human benefit.  
Sitting in traffic always makes me tyred.
Lol, again what doesnt fit what we believe to many choose to misconceive. Listen to what is said in the video and youll clearly see that your statement is incorrect. If you did listen, what SPECIFICALLY do you disagree with?
Your views are all fear based with no scientific basis in reality. 
That cheap financial cost has a huge environmental costs and finances have zero value in the abyss, which is what were headed for a fate just like the dinosaurs. Also new venture always lead to new industrys leading to new jobs and new money to go into our economy. I did read your entire rant and I agree that government is currently corrupt, but its because it contains far too many leaders who know how to how to use the system effectively for their own personal gain and are great at dupeing the masses into believing their lies with propaganda and feeding people confirmation biases. I totally agree with that. The difference is the current moron in charge is doing so poorly that EVERYBODY is watching and since we live in the world of social media things are no longer private and true character is being exposed all across the board. This means that new people are stepping up and others will fall. We are definitely in a mess right now,  but things are either going to start changing or peoples fear to do so will destroy us all. If you want to know my actual view about all of this listen to me explain it if youve actually got an open mind. Id love to hear what specificity you disagree with within it...

Oil companies provide cheap and easily accessible energy that powers our lifestyle. Venezuela nationalized its oil and look at how they're doing...
but that would make their bullshit stronger than ever
I dont want the federal government to control our lives, I want it to do its job and protect its people. Unfortunately money has power to shape thought in a world that can be bought and because of massive corporations like these oil companies having  an ability to buy whatever view they want from whatever professional position they wish to convey from and then get it broadcast over media as if it were valid and give this stupidity legs. They clearly are doing this for their own personal interests, and then, well the whole message gets corrupt and people rightfully so lose trust. That said man just look around you and youll see the predictions from actual scientists claims from decades ago coming true with all these new extreme weather patterns. Theres plenty more evidence out there too but you clearly choose to look around it to fit your narrative. We also know by looking at earths sister planet Venus at just how badly things can get as the atmosphere changes. Once things get to a certain point the rate of change takes on an exponential fashion and things go awry. Look man, just by reading your rant I can already tell you are of an unchangeable mindset if youre discrediting statistics and asking for real evidence. We are a dopamine chasing discomfort avoiding creatures and to be right is to feel good, in a world misunderstood and what doesnt fit what we believe too many choose to misconceive. There is a whole lot of propaganda going around in this new fully connected world. Moreso now than ever in the history of history in fact because of things like social media. History has proven that propaganda works, dont forget that that is part of the equation. These huge oil companies clearly are scared of a shift in energy consumption and theyve got just the tool to help shape thought, its called money. Dont be fooled my friend, you seem to worry about agenda, but theres clearly one there too.  
Democrats, climate campaigners and renewable energy interests are in full outrage mode over news that President Trump intends to launch a Presidential Committee on Climate Science. He should do it now.
The PCCS would, at long last, review and question the dangerous manmade climate change reports by federal agencies and investigations funded by them. The committee would be led by Dr. Will Happer, a highly respected scientist and well known skeptic  not of climate change, but of manmade climate chaos. He would be joined by other prominent experts  of whom there are many  who share his doubts.
No way! the climate alarmists rant. How dare you question our disaster claims? Our settled science?
No! How dare YOU use those claims to justify your agenda  and your continued efforts to bludgeon and silence us into submission  without letting anyone examine, much less debate, your supposed evidence?
For years, you have loudly and incessantly asserted that the United States and world must end fossil fuel use, or we are doomed. Now youre demanding that the United States completely upend its energy production, transportation and manufacturing sectors, housing and office buildings, and entire economy. You want the federal government to control and limit our lives, choices and living standards  and redistribute our wealth, even to those unwilling to work, according to confiscatory socialist principles.
For years, you Democrats, environmentalists, Deep State bureaucrats, government-grant-dependent scientists, news and social media have colluded to censor and silence manmade climate chaos skeptics, and stifle any debate. All of you have huge financial, reputational and power stakes in this.
Your Climate Industrial Complex is a $2-trillion-per-year global behemoth. Your Green New Deal would cost this nation up to $93 trillion by 2030  sticking every US family with a $65,000 annual bill.
And still you insist that the science is settled, that there is no room for discussion, that we must act immediately to save the planet from climate and extreme weather disaster. Now you want to wrap up your kangaroo court proceedings  with our side given no opportunity to present our evidence, defend fossil fuels and carbon dioxide, examine your alleged evidence, or cross-examine your experts.
If your evidence is so solid and unimpeachable, you should be more than happy to lay it on the table, subject it to scrutiny, question our experts, and let us question yours  extensively and mercilessly.
After all, the future of our planet is at stake  or so you claim. The future of our country certainly is.
Your radical agenda and actions are un-American, totalitarian, anti-science, and contrary to our most fundamental principles of open, robust debate  on one of the most critical issues in US history.
A large majority of Americans believe our planet has warmed and is warming. No one denies that. And thank goodness, or wed still be stuck in the Little Ice Age. But thats not the issue. The issues are: Is any likely future warming going to be disastrous? And are humans and fossil fuels to blame?
You claim the answer is Yes. Again, where is your proof? If you have any actual evidence, lay it on the table. Show us exactly where the natural forces that have driven countless climate changes throughout history end  and where the human factors begin. Quantify them. Dont give us computer models that simply reflect the assumptions that went into them. Present solid, Real World evidence. If you have any.
While youre at it, you also need to prove that dismantling Americas energy and economic system will make one whit of difference in our climate and weather (assuming for the sake of argument that human carbon dioxide emissions now drive climate and weather)  when China, India and other countries are building thousands of coal and natural gas fueled power plants, and millions of cars and trucks.
Their emissions already dwarf ours. And they are not going to give up fossil fuels for decades, if ever.
Prove your GND energy system can actually power America, without destroying jobs, living standards, manufacturing, health, prosperity and environment. As I have said over, over and over, it cannot be done. Your alternatives are not workable, affordable, green, renewable, ethical, ecological or sustainable.
Heres just a few of the Real World climate science facts that alarmists dont want exposed or discussed.
Temperatures have risen by tenths or hundredths of a degree in recent years  less than the margin of error, and most of the highest temperatures on record have been in urban areas, where local manmade heat skews the data. Were also experiencing record cold and snow in numerous locations.
The average prediction by 102 climate models is now a full degree Fahrenheit above what satellites are measuring. Michael Manns climate model could concoct hockey sticks from telephone numbers and other random numbers. Are we supposed to trust these models on critical energy policy?
Violent tornadoes (F3 to F5) averaged 56 per year from 1950 to 1985. But from 1986 to 2018 only 34 per year touched down in the USA on average  and for the first time ever not one did in 2018. The March 3 Alabama tornado was tragic, and the 2-mile-wide 2013 Oklahoma City monster lasted 40 minutes. But the 1925 Tri-State Twister was a mile wide, traveled a record 220 miles, lasted a record 3.5 hours, and killed a record 695 people.
Hurricanes becoming more frequent and intense? From 1920 through 1940, ten Category 3-5 hurricanes made US landfall; from 1960 through 1980, eleven; 1980 through 2000, ten; 2001 through 2018, nine. There is no trend. Moreover, Harvey and Irma in 2017 were the first category 3-5 hurricanes to make U.S. landfall in a record twelve years. The previous record was nine years, set in the Civil War era.
A warmer Arctic? The Washington Post did report that the Arctic Ocean is warming up, icebergs are growing scarcer, and in some places seals are finding the water too hot. But that was in 1922!
Polar bear populations are the highest on record: between 24,500 and 28,500 or more of them!
Oceans cannot become more acidic, because they are not and have never been acidic. Earths oceans are slightly alkaline. That slight alkalinity has decreased slightly (from 8.2 on the pH scale to 8.1) over the past few decades. But they are not getting acidic  and wont anytime soon.
Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. It is the miracle molecule without which most life on Earth would cease to exist. In fact, the more CO2 in the air, the faster and better crop, forest and grassland plants grow  and the better they can withstand droughts, diseases, and damage from insects and viruses.
In fact, a slightly warmer planet with more atmospheric CO2 would be tremendously beneficial for plants, wildlife and humanity. A colder planet with less carbon dioxide would greatly reduce arable land extent, growing seasons, wildlife habitats, crop production and our ability to feed humanity.
Millions of Americans are exasperated with Republicans like Congressman John Shimkus of Illinois, who recently whined that its just not worth the fight anymore to battle climate alarmism  and protect our nation and our childrens future. Elected officials like him need to get spinal implants, learn the Climate Facts, or resign and turn their seats over to someone who will fight for us. Thats why we need the PCCS.
Its why they hope the President Trump we elected to clean out the Deep State  show why manmade climate chaos claims are pseudo-science  and Make America Great Again for decades to come  will demonstrate his toughness and leadership right now, when we so need him to.
We need to tell Mr. Trump: Please stand up to these Climate Totalitarians who want to destroy our nation, in the name of saving the planet from climate disasters that exist only in computer models, Hollywood movies, and self-serving assertions by the Climate Industrial Complex. Alarmists have controlled the climate narrative thus far. Now we need to give other experts a chance to weigh in, loud and clear.
Appoint your Presidential Committee on Climate Science now! Give sound, honest science a chance.

Ahh, you are correct that the cat is not actually in two states at once, of course it's meant to be a metaphor to explain quantum effects on tiny things, which actually are in two different states at once. I've been waiting for James Webb for most of my adult life! I'll be holding my breath for that launch.
Well... is it a joke, or is it reality? You won't know till you take a look.
The theory that until observed, everything is in all possible states (the cat reference in OP)

Quantum mechanics, physics, computing, is how I spend all my free time lately. It's amazing. So many areas of wonder and amazement. And thanks to YouTube, it's right there too be enjoyed. 

But a cat inside a box is not BOTH alive and dead until you open the box. It's one or the other.

Unrelated, I can't wait until James Webb gets launched.

What are you looking most forward to being answered in upcoming years either from cosmology, LCH, quantum computing, etc? 
What theory is garbage, quantum theory? If so I assume you have a better theory to replace it?
You messed up the joke! Allow me... "I asked the librarian for books about Pavlov's Dog and Schrodinger's Cat. She said it rings a bell but she cant tell if they're here or not"

This theory is garbage. It's exactly like saying a tree fell in the woods but didn't make sound and also did make sound because nobody was there to hear it. 
I asked her to check. She said. "No we don't"
I replied, "Well now you don't!"
This is fucking golden. I like that part with the line.
This would have fit perfectly into "Airplane!" 
Well before asking, the book will both be there and not be there. It's not until you ask that you learn the truth of it's availablity. 
Don't know what to tell you. It doesn't look like that on my screen even though I got the official reddit app. Maybe I got a different font or text setting, I don't know.

Hello boat mate!

They are trying to seem un-diligent, but by complaining that they have tried everything to make it seem that way, they are showing that they are in fact diligent, thereby undermining their goal
They've been really diligent to not seem diligent
"I've done all I can" can be used to sound like you've done something when you haven't really done anything at all. 
Help i don't get it 
Dang my feeble mind!
I hate that sentence so much. My teacher used to have it on a poster and it bugged me every fucking time I saw it. 
When we were kids my dad used to drop us off at school and say, "Now  behave yourselves, even if it's bad." When I was little I didn't get it so I asked my grandpa, who said that it meant my dad  would rather have us misbehave than not behave at all, because that would mean we'd be dead.  But irreverent humor doesn't appeal to everyone I guess.
r/whoosh
LoL. No, it's actually kinda funny. It reminds me of what my dad always said, that there's something wrong today, because there are people dying who has never done so before. 
It's really hard, isn't it? 
Glad you appreciate it. It's kinda sad that what is considered "humor" today centers mostly around penis jokes and word plays. 
COMPARE TO: You may think its cool to break the law but you forgot about the consequences
What? Cool == fun...
This is a joke group. Take your life truths elsewhere to people who shall appreciate them as much as I do lol
Also he can't have a period because he has a penis.

We had 72 candles on my grandmother's small cake on her birthday. It was literally this. The heat melted the candles much faster than usual and the first candles lit were basically gone by the time the last ones were lit. She didn't blow them out; We waited for it to die down. Then the reality of this joke. There was a pool of hot wax on top of the icing. Only it wasn't just on top because it had melted the icing and the two were now fused together. A disgusting useless alloy of butter, sugar and wax. The cake was ruined. Terrible idea.

Next time I do it I'll figure out how to light the candles faster. I'm thinking some sort of fuse. 
I was in drum corps until the bass drum said horrible things about me during a performance and I quit.

 Thinking about creating a cricket joke here as well.

It is often used as an adverb, but that doesn't mean it's used correctly as an adverb. I don't know about other languages, but English is so fluid when it comes to what's grammatically correct. If enough people use a word incorrectly, it'll eventually be accepted as correct. But at one time "real" was the adjective and "really" was the adverb.

Tl;dr I'm so nerdy that I'll over-analyze (and kill) a joke for the sake of grammar.
"Real" is often used as an adverb.

That's ok, because I like my women like I like my beer - cold, bitter, and full of yeast.
BMW quit putting a dipstick or any way to manually check the oil years ago. You have to go into the vehicle settings on the screen on the console and see what it says.

Like the first joke, funny if you're a mechanic.
A friend of mine works in an auto shop and had someone actually ask for a longer dipstick. My friend almost got fired for laughing.
I don't believe you.
Get a short throw dipstick for the weight savings.
A what now ?.
I've seen this in another form

&gt;  If a tree falls and hits a &lt;person people tend to dislike: mime, sports fan, etc.&gt;, and no one is around to hear it, does anyone care?
So youre saying OP is a dipshit?

No the song is trash. Happy cake day dork!
[I get it.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/433/792/fcc)

A dipstick is a rod or stick in your car that is used to measure the oil level. Usually there is a bar ranging from like 1 inch to 3 inches that shows you maximum and minimum oil levels.

Even when you are well below minimum, you will still have oil show up on the bottom of the dipstick.

In order to fix this problem, instead of adding more oil, like you are supposed to he is getting a longer dipstick. Which only fixes the indication of the problem, but not the problem itself. Kind of like saying buying a gas gage that measures tea spoons instead of getting more gas. 

... Yeah I don't think it's very funny either. 
Car is so low on oil, it's not showing on dipstick anymore.
he needs oil not a dipstick
Neither do I.

Taking the p out of rapper
I agree with your downvoted comments m8. As somebody who loves rap, used to love R. Kelly, and loves a good joke, I thought this whole joke setup was really clever because it didn't prematurely give away what the punchline was going to be. Then I thought, wait, I can't think of one rap by R Kelly. Then I realized the joke isn't about R Kelly. It's ready for any rapper's name to go there. If Kobe Bryant ever picks up the mic, this joke will work for his name too. And in conclusion, there should be a subreddit for R Kelly jokes, called r/Kelly.

R Kelly was never a rapper. This is one of those jokes people just adapt to the flavor of the minute, isn't it?
OP is well meaning.
Can I use you as my summoning jutsu?
Well, not really correct. If you had like 10 guys with 60% and 10 guys with 90%, the joke would work, but in any other case it wouldn't. Take for example having 10 people with 17% and 3 people with 86%. The average would be (10*0.17+3*0.86)130.32. In that case only 3 people have above average and 10 people have below average grades.

He was the _least_ Ruth-less; in other words, he had more Ruth than the others.

This is more of a shower thought than a one liner

Actually, he was tied for most ruthless with a ton of other dudes.
A side vote 
Umm, you know he married someone called Ruth, right? You and the eighteen others.
I'm betting they'll have his last scene in endgame, and after wards in the next spiderman they'll have a scene like that without him, where you feel like he should appear.

So before hee, he was without Ruth. Ruthless.

He married Ruth 
I don't get it pls someone explain
Good point. But in that case this might have worked even better: "According to the bible before Boas got married he was a ruthless man."
Most people are ruthless. I'd say the opposite: After he got married, Boas was the least ruthless man in the Bible.

Cant be separated. 
Well, usually those involve multiple sentences, or are separated for comedic effect, despite still being able to be on the same line otherwise.
So are many jokes.
The setup and punchline are separated.

**One-line joke**

A one-liner is a joke that is delivered in a single line. A good one-liner is said to be pithy - concise and meaningful. Comedians and actors use this comedic method as part of their act, e.g. Jimmy Carr, Tommy Cooper, Rodney Dangerfield, Norm Macdonald, Ken Dodd, Stewart Francis, Zach Galifianakis, Mitch Hedberg, Anthony Jeselnik, Milton Jones, Shappi Khorsandi, Jay London, Mark Linn-Baker, Demetri Martin, Groucho Marx, Dan Mintz, Emo Philips, Tim Vine, Steven Wright and Henny Youngman and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Yeah I dont get it, OP easily could have taken that period out
Not a one liner, but funny all the same.

Yes, the adult site should have a review video. Because if the adult site provides the review video then it will be easier for the audience to see the most liked video. This becomes most advantages part for the site to provide the review video. According to me the site which I can refer you is [xxx Korean](https://koreaninhd.com/). In this site, you can provide the likes, comment for adult video. That helps the audience to encourage to watch the adult video in the site   
Yes
Good one. Did you see the picture (this isnt a joke) the other day of the dwarfs dressed up as Hitler? Someone put the comment 1/3 Reich.

Well, Orange you the clever one.
I go back to read this comment like everyday. Its perfect and i cant thank you enough for it.
Birthdays had + birthdays left is constant
not fast enough
The number of birthdays is inversely proportional to the remaining number of birthdays...
Birthdays are like beer. Too many and you'll die. 
I was gonna say something similiar. Birthdays are like air, not having them is deadly.
Statistically, the more birthdays you have the longer you live. 
Well I dont think you should just give up so easily. No, Id suggest repeating the attempted seed sucking once and even then if that attempt should result in a negative conclusion Id warrant repeating the act a further time at least. Well, thats what my male parents own male parent used to suggest verbally by way of communicating a life lesson passed down thusly to him by male parents of older times still.
Not to be negative, but are you thinking of dying the electrons? 
... so she wanted to sook your cocks? How do you sook something, and what's life like with more than one cock?
Does cook rhyme with suck in this joke?
Well I guess it is pretty divided right now.

When people use "I've" for a possessive "I have", it makes me feel weirdly aggressive.
Victor Borge had a party of his show about "language inflation" and did jokes like this one
I never, *ever* exaggerate.
"You have three of the saddest eyes I've ever seen"...  

"In the distance, a clock struck thirteen"...
"I nined my elevenderloin with my fivek."
Don't you mean exaggernine? 
He "exaggerated" the 10 ("ten") in "tendency" to 11. It's a ripoff (possibly unintentionally) of Victor Borge's hilarious bit on "speech inflation".

Perhaps Piggorian Chant (By Sandra Boynton) would work better for you. Seriously, look it up, she's a genius at being not serious.
That's a bit long-winded; the second half of the line adds nothing to the joke, so the actual pun is in the middle of the joke, rather than the end. Comedic effect is often diminished if one extends a joke's length past what is needed to build it up to full effect. More concisely: Brevity is the soul of wit.

This is the truth. To be honest, it's the people who try to make me feel terrible for finding humor in all this that actually make me want to die more because why live in a world where you can't laugh about walking off nearly unscathed after jumping into a river from a 50 foot bridge. Phone was almost completely fine too, it just can't read a Sim card due to a tiny short in one of the connections between the card reader and the motherboard that couldn't be found. 4 months later and and I realized that the key to happiness is to not take everything so seriously, just the things in which being serious would help you, which are far fewer than you may initially believe in reality.

Congratulations! You deserve a drink. (Its just a bottle. Theres no ham-fisted attempt at a pig joke here. ) 

Its because you wrote 4 paragraphs because you were angry that people downvoted your comment when just a couple minutes before that you were happy and some downvoted changed your attitude extremely fast. Also because your sentences are very confusing to read and it looks like you are having a conversation with yourself out loud except its on text. And your post history shows this isnt a single occurrence of this behavior.

I know its a joke but wouldnt that still be helpful for the police using a BOLO? I mean a good description of the car helps them know what to look for but the license plate number would confirm that its your car right? 
I told somebody this joke on the spurt of the moment
[deleted]
I really like this.

Democracy is another word for "mob rule".
better to have 1 wolf and 2 sheep huh
The US is a republic that protects the individual because a true democracy is like two wolves and a sheep voting for what's for dinner. 
I came across this first, thought haha. Then I go back to being a loser on reddit and come back to it and just get the pun. Fuck me take that upvote

ajokeor acleverandfunnyremarkoranswerthat is usually onesentencelong:"

 You are prime dunning kruger. 
. . .
It was not obviously a joke. And you are getting down votes for going on and on, making numerous rambling comments. 
Hah! Good one. 
Wtf is wrong with u
Is that it? You asked if I was alright? Im not. Did you really want to be involved...or help? . . Or was that useless criticism? . . .
This is not a one liner

Useless criticism. . . . Is that not the definition of downvoting? Is that not what Im angry about? What I said was obviously a supposed to be a joke. Every day on the one liner site people call people out for putting more than one line in and no one bats an eyelid. This was just people jumping on, bullying. Karma is about your intent not peoples approval. 

Thats the irony, the only bad karma comes when you just wander past and inject a negative act into a thing and mooch off to do it somewhere else. Good karma is seeing someone who is stressed and being got at and defending them despite the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. 

The bigger irony is, and what I am very worried about, is that this division is global and there are even people believing we are under a dome on a flat planet. Many people are screaming for unity on their own side to kill the people not part of unity. 

If you dont know whats coming I can try and explain some things but most of it you will find hard to hear. 
Bud-um bum! (rimshot)
Choice. It was a joke about a joke. Ive explained very carefully what Im angry about. 
Dude are you OK? You seem very angry for no reason. Reddit is not like a conversation on a bus, the whole point is that anyone can comment, anyone can respond to each other's comments, and you up vote or downvoted comments based on how much you agree, or if you feel the comment adds to the discussion. Your original comment did not add to the discussion at all
HAH! Well you wasted that question. 
Are you mental? 
My comment was to the guy who wrote the joke. It was a joke about his joke to HIM. This place allows you to see my comment. If in a bar or on a bus and talking to someone, other people can hear right? And everyone who walks past all give you a little downvote ticket dont they? Or dont they? 

Youre telling me to chill out when Im getting deliberately targeted by people who have nothing to say. Pack animal herbivores jumping on the jab at this guy boat. And the world is about to change. Lots of division. I spend a lot of time on sites promoting unity and peace and I come here for a FUCKING BREAK AND A LAAAARF! 


Dude you had one line...
Yea this doesn't really seem forced at all? What are you talking about man
Is that when you say rude words when youre making the beast with two backs?
I guess you don't like oral sex?
I wish I knew how to vote on this.
Ooo! Nice. And well done for shoe horning it into one line. . . Oh yes you cheeky boy, we all see what you did. This sub. is used by twenty six trillion people. The two liner sub. is frequented by around a dozen. So, yep, Good one! and...eyes on you

A song by a-ha that I like has the lyric "I used to be confused, but now I just don't know"
Gosh. I had some guy the other day got though a whole thing I wrote and all he did was write Bruges. . .because I missed the S off the end. . . The silent S. . . Nothing to say about anything else. Not even a Hey. 

Anywho, so yeah Im a bit fragile and the world has just changed. Obama Bush and Clinton aressted and J A free. Big big changes. Need unity not conflict. Look how charged up I am . . . Gosh what a time to be alive. . . So, thanks for replying and being cool dude. Have a beautiful day.
Lol, hey man I didnt down vote it. I thought it was funny. Meant nothin negative by the comment. Didnt know it was such a personal issue. 
. . . Change it. . . Or is that too easy for you so you thought youd vote me down, call me up and tell me and Im supposed to change it for you. . . Its a five word joke. . . Or its just five words you are a bit concerned dont sound right in your voice, accent, country or hemisphere. Julian Assange is free, the US elite are in jail and you think this dont sound right? . . I promise Ill think much harder about this next time. Just for you. Happy New Year btw.

Yeah well I got flashed by some total cock but couldn't prick him out in a line up. Erect my whole day. 
I knew a Sevillian nurse in the war. A thick cut, pithy woman known to us grunts as Lady Marmalade. Many of the jams we got into at the time were very sticky and virtually fruitless, leaving a bad taste in our mouths. But she was like a golden shread of sunshine, top of the pectin order you might say, really I couldn't condiment her more highly. Her door was always ajar and we toasted her at every opportunity, bewitched by her sweet yet tarty complexity.

 We tried hard to orange for her to come back with us but we had to break fast out of our positions and she fell. Before I could react she landed with her buttered face down on the carpet. . . As I kind of knew she would. 

My memories of this time have grown cold now, replaced by other, fresher rounds of breadly confrontation but try as I might something of Marmalade still remains. An aftertaste unclensed and unclensible, by this new unsevilised society. . . Let us pray...

I might try homeopathy sometime, if I could pay for it with water that I had dipped money into.
No, that's vaccination, which is a proven life saver.
Very nice! Took me a second :)
#THAT MEANS ITS SUPPER EFFECTIVE!
The bullshit comes with the theory that the water retains a "memory" of what was in it, still making it effective.

If that were the case, then we're all drinking homeopathetic water that retains the memory of all the shit and piss from fish, dolphins, whales, humans, hippos, etc.

Enjoy.
Homeopathy is essentially just consuming small amounts of what's causing the problem. For example, if you have insomnia and just can't fall asleep, according to homeopathy you'd drink some super watered down coffee. The more watered down, the more effective, even if it's statistically unlikely there's even any coffee molecules left in there (which is why many people find it bullshit).
I didnt expect anyone to get it...
No, we call that one "principal square root". "the" just refers to the function usually, and that one is allowed to be multi-valued.
Opposite actually, it's consuming tiny amounts of cure every day or something 
*NOTHING* is just as effective, because homeopathy is essentially nothing. 
Please explain to major dingus here, isnt homeopathy injecting tiny amounts of disease into you?
Did you mean Butt Plug?
This took me a second
Except *the* square root refers to principle square root which is single valued.

Wouldn't "***she told me she was hoping to cut her losses***" sound even better?

Before I forget, I want to stress how thankful I am for your feedback!
In that case I'd use "she *had* hoped to cut her losses", since it's in the past.

How about "**she hoped to cut her losses**"?

*I asked my mother why she stopped breastfeeding me when I was two weeks old, and she told me she hoped to cut her losses*
r/suicidebywords

Also, "she was cutting her losses" sounds good to me.
Couldve said pull out of take off
Huh, this one has a lot of potential; especially the part about factory settings.

"**My sisters were playing with a Ouija Board, and they became so terrorized that they accidentally hit the "*****Factory reset*****" button. They have a haunted plank of wood now.**"

You know, something along the way.
Butt why? 
Yep. 
For anyone confused,

Incorrectly is spelled correctly when its spelled incorrectly.

At least thats what I think it was supposed to be. OP might have messed it up.
The only time correctly is spelled correctly is when it's spelled correctly.
looks like you've been played by your own joke lmao
Incorrectly is such a loser, that even when it's spelled correctly it's spelled incorrectly.
Hope you don't find yourself in a hole.
No, then it wouldn't be speller incorrectly
Incorrectly is the only word that is spelled incorrectly no matter how you spell it, correctly or not.
The only time incorrectly is spelled "incorrectly" is when it's spelled correctly.
I actually was, but poor execution, sorry.

All this talk of double negatives had me confused. So when they said the post was written incorrectly, it was a great opportunity for me to say that it means it's the only time it was written correctly, just to add to the confusion. 
Yall are making me stroke out
nope. I sincerely hope that you're trolling.
The correctness of the whole sentence doesn't have anything to do with what the sentence is trying to say.

anyway cant help if you cant even repost well
r/badjokes
Which means it's the only time this title is spelt correctly 
thats exactly what he said, word-to-word. Your post however, is written incorrectly.
The only time incorrectly is spelled correctly (adverb), is when it's spelled "incorrectly". 

However, you're right too
It looks like you meant to say the only time incorrectly is spelled correctly is when its spelled incorrectly
Exactly
It's far from the only time
Nope, incorrectly is also spelled incorrectly when it's spelled "asdghsjdga" for example. 
my brain hurts

So you have to spell in incorrectly then. 
Impossible. 6 year olds dont understand being treated like a child. 
look, i think this guy's post more or less follows the spirit of a one liner, while not literally being a one liner. Though, yes, it's TWO sentences, it still carries the same shoddy joke schematic of a one liner, which is good enough for me. Ease up on me.
Because sometimes the content is just too good to not upvote

The Great "W" once commented that the French didn't even have a word for entrepreneur in an effort to belittle their business acumen.

Goddammit, fuck both of you. I was getting ready to sneer and downvote the original post's play-on-words, but now this shit is funny and I can't in good conscience downvote any of it.  

I have no idea how to quantify my pun standards.  I honestly cannot tell you why the original post title makes me feel "meh", but the resulting comments "You can't soyvive after something like that" and "I'll take that as a condiment!" apparently strike me as pure gold.

I've had some rough times before and I think the only people who get mad about it are the people who don't understand it's a coping mechanism. Chances are if I'm laughing saying "Wow I'd better get the rope out again", I'm probably not gonna do that. The time to be worried is when the person is in so much pain that they can't even make a joke anymore.

I don't understand people that don't find these types of jokes funny.

I was suicidal for about 2 years like a year ago and I joke about it all the time. I've stopped 2 of my good friends killing themselves and I can still laugh about it.

Maybe it's because I deal with things in humour,  but I get what are jokes and what aren't, and it just annoys me that people get so sensitive about it.
You obviously have never committed suicide else you certainly wouldn't be making jokes about it.

It's a running gag due to the fact an apprentice will, without fail, always put coolant in a transmission.

This is super bad for a transmission since coolant is typically water based and water on your clutch packs creates rust and generally bad things. This results in a massive time sink into changing out what was a perfectly running transmission.

**Acidbase titration**

An acidbase titration is a method of quantitative analysis for determining the concentration of an acid or base by exactly neutralizing it with a standard solution of base or acid having known concentration. A pH indicator is used to monitor the progress of the acidbase reaction. If the acid dissociation constant (pKa) of the acid or base in the analyte solution is known, its solution concentration (molarity) can be determined. Alternately, the pKa can be determined if the analyte solution has a known solution concentration by constructing a titration curve.

Oh my god that is the best belly laugh I've had in weeks! That's a good one.
I'm not arguing against the grammatical aspects, and I understand what transitive verbs are, which means I understand the subject is structurally irrelevant.

What we're having here is a friendly disagreement on whether "poltergeist" is logically more suitable as a subject vs. an indirect object.

Additionally, I'm hoping I can once again find a sense of humor after being re-re-pedantic.
r/showerthoughts
Their are not
4/3rds of people are bad at fractions
not when you're behind that ass
I understand what you're saying, the most common subject of the verb \*"posses"\* would be poltergeist, but it's a transitive verb so a person could also be the subject i.e.

&gt;*"a poltergeist possessed my home."* **(most common)**  
&gt;  
&gt;*"the person possessed my home \[with a poltergeist\]."*

The words in brackets are optional.

Similar to the verb *"clean"*

&gt;*"the bleach cleaned the table"*  
&gt;  
&gt;*"the person cleaned the table \[with the bleach\]"* **(most common)**

Both are grammatically correct. I used exorcist as the subject, as it makes more sense to engage in a financial transaction with an *exorcist* than a *poltergeist*. And if a person knew how to exorcise, it's possible they may also know how to posses too (i.e. release the poltergeists from the proton pack)
Because the exorcist unpossessed it (casted out the spirits) so they left, didnt get his money so brought them right back. Its a damn good joke mr taint
An exorcist casts out spirits, but they don't possess homes.  How can they repossess a home without possessing it first?  

Just like this case, where I was at first pedantic, and now I'm re-pedantic. 
What need a poltergeist for money? Surely the one casting the spirit from the home should be paid
I like it, but I think it should be "poltergeist" not "exorcist".  

EDIT: I've haunted this joke long enough, but I will need payment to leave.

Hey BooCMB, just a quick heads up:
The spelling hints really aren't as shitty as you think, the 'one lot' actually helped me learn and remember as a non-native english speaker.

They're not *completely* useless. Most of them are. Still, don't bully somebody for trying to help.

Also, remember that these spambots will continue until yours stops. Do the right thing, for the community. Yes I'm holding Reddit for hostage here.

Oh, and while i doo agree with you precious feedback loop -creating comment, andi do think some of the useless advide should be removed and should just show the correction, I still don't support flaming somebody over trying to help, shittily or not.

Thanks, partner!
Hey guys, Peter Griffin here to explain the joke. You see, this joke has a humorous take on the learning disorder named dyslexia. Dyslexia is a disorder in which a person viewing text may unconsciously rearrange the letter of said text, making it difficult for them to read correctly. Now, this joke depicts a person afflicted by this disorder taking the hallucinogenic drug named LSD, which is short for Lysergic Acid Diethylamide, but that isnt important to the joke. What is important is what occurs when you rearrange the letters in LSD, as a person with dyslexia may do. By swapping the second and third letters, the acronym then becomes LDS, which is a shortened version of the Latter-day Saints, which is a shortened version of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This Church is associated with the Mormon religion, hence the aforementioned dyslexic person becoming a Mormon. Quite funny! If you need any jokes explained just type /u/PeterGriffinJokeHelp

I think we just need to be more responsible. Learn to check for the validity of things you read and to make your own mind. We can see what other people everywhere are thinking without poisoning our ability to reason, we just need to be smart about it.

TL;DR, don't blame social media, blame idiots who let it form their opinions or conquer their lives. Teaching people to get along is better than isolating them.
Every day I have that same thought. It certainly seems like it. While human nature doesn't change, and humans have never been the nicest species, I do think society goes in cycles. When the better angels of our nature are inspired, you get a  Renaissance. When our more demonic side is engage, a Holocaust. But nowadays, social media has collapsed the necessary distance between people, shattered that personal bubble we need for our mental well-being. Everyone is living inside each other's head, usually screaming about this or that, and we have all been going insane and getting snarly and mean, always spoiling for a fight. It has to stop. Social media will be the death of us.

Not to mention that chiropractors really are quacks and I was just making a joke. Don't ever let a friend go to a chiropractor. I worked beside of one in a mall and all they did was scam old people.

Because it is a conservative narrative like the ones pushed by Fox.. 

See my reddit post a few weeks ago which contrasts the Three Pigs Conservative narrative with Red Riding Hood's liberal message.
.
https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/9nvc7e/the_three_pigs_has_a_conservative_message_strong/

Of course, both are oversimplified, as all narratives are; for example, the child's story overlooks precisely how the third pig earned his bricks. As you know as an adult, the cost of materials is the biggest barrier towards building a house. If liberals (blue collar) and conservatives (white collar) were all given building materials with the provision that they must build the house with their own two hands, who would have a house?

You might be right tbf.. Google says the proper pronunciation for forte only applies to musical talent. However, in my personal 30 years of experience, most people who pronounce it otherwise are made fun of.

Hey Mitch!

Is she dead now?
*chuckle chuckle*
No, it's perfectly typed :)

Just that it needs to be said out loud randomly for it to have it's full effect.
Yeah, definitely. I thought of it but had no idea how I should type it out. I'm hoping most people will get it without hearing it. 
Definitely works better out loud, but upvoted because I'll use it that way when I tell it.
He didn't hit him with the hand, he hit him with a car. It's quite literal.

The I would rather would throw this off because it assumes there was a previous statement that is being conflicted with

ThEn is used when relating something to time.


So it makes a joke within a joke - it read like the person wants to die AND have sex with a necrophiliac.

Yes interest in them dies pretty quickly.
well... that's likely the TV version. It happens.
They'll tease bringing him back for a while and then it will turn out to be some cheesy new superhero who just looks like him.
Ouch 
Nice joke, but ironic is not a synonym for fitting
Grown man do heal me 
"Thank God I'm an atheist, because Christians are always contradicting themselves." would be the actual oneliner of this.
Y'know, the most respectful thing they could do is to have a scene where a character needs to go buy a newspaper or ask for directions... and nobody's there. Have a moment of silence.
They didn't though. They're gonna keep him alive through all of the cameos.
Too soon

Honestly, I wouldnt be surprised if thats what he wanted. Once they run out of scenes of him, he doesnt seem like the type that would want to be put in the movies using computer programs. He probably pre filmed a scene of him dying and people will cry like babies and thats what he most likely wanted. A last hurrah 
Right but even if the joke is weak, it's not 'too soon' as it doesn't do anything distasteful towards Stan Lee or his legacy in my opinion.

Too soon dude
The humour here isn't 'haha Stan Lee is dead', it's 'He played cameos so frequently he was basically a character int he films he created'.  It's not dark or disrespectful.
This reads like an Onion headline. 
Theres no such thing as too soon when it comes to comedy, but this isnt even remotely funny.
IDK why, but I feel like this doesn't fit this sub.
Maybe it better fits r/toosoon
Way too soon
Because it's funny. Have a fucking sense of humor.

On a serious note though, both sides of the post for the girl and boy objectify women. According to OP, growing up is all about sex with women. Some girls don't get much in the way of breasts, some get lots, and the boys focus here is on girls bra's coming off? Where's the respect? Where's the growing up that doesn't involved physicality? This implies that all girls grow up to be used by boys and all boys only grow up if they can get a girls clothes off.

OP is just stupid and shallow. Childish really.
Too soon.

Damn I meant to type a hash sign
# checkmate
One liner. Then another. No one got it I guess.
To be fair, the actual post is kinda creepy, too. It's pretty common for girls to start wearing some kind of bra at age 11-12. The joke is sexualizing preteens.

Mostly unrelated: I had sex long before I figured out bras. I'm 30 now and I'm pretty sure it varies by brand. Sometimes I can snap it off with one hand. Other times I look like a kid stuck in a Chinese finger trap.
Why? It is served on dish? or an open buffet breakfast?
Weird flex but okay.

Eh depends on who you say that to in the south. Reminds me of a Robin Williams joke that went: "Hey baby are your parents retarded? Cuz you sure are special."

Is it constantly blurry or only when exercising ir so?

Constantly: go to an ophtalmologist. Either you just need glasses or it could be worse, an inflammation of your optical nerve. I had this once in one eye, it started small (I thought there was a grease spot on my glasses) and ended in only 5% vision with that eye. But don't panic, now everything is like before :)

Not constantly: could have something to do with your blood circulation, for this I would go to a general practitioner. They can tell you/send you to a special doctor who fits your case

Yeah i thought so afterwards. I translated it from german ("Selbstsicherheit sieht nur von unten aus wie Arroganz") and I noticed that some of the meaning (and therefore  the "Joke") gets kinda lost in translation, as In couldn't translate it literally.

It's meant as a whitty Comeback if someone tells you that you're arrogant.

I once read a "statistic" in a newspaper article bashing teachers that said, "1 out of 10 teachers are performing worse than 90% of their colleagues."

And I was like... yep, that's how math works. 
Grammatically, and dramatically, you and OP are incorrect. Your comment, however, would be, if "the last bit" could be omitted, without changing the overall sentence, then, you'd be solid. OP only needs to add another word, and comma, to solidify his statement as "because, otherwise, if it were served warm", or if he, simply, changed 'because' to 'otherwise', and omit 'if it were served warm', all together.

&amp;#x200B;

undecidable. True or false is meta information, for our logic system to work. If you short circuit it into the assertion, you may get undecidable things flip flopping every time you parse them.

Its true then....but its false so would it be false? Because if it were false then it wouldnt be true because of it were false then the sentence is true, but if it isnt false then its false which makes it true but makes it false????

It was organized in 1975 byFirst Wisconsin National Bank,Marshall &amp; Ilsley,Marine Bank of MilwaukeeandMidland National Bankand was one of the first sharedEFTnetwork in the country.[1][2]Residents commonly referred to ATMs as a "TYME machine," which resulted in confusion when Wisconsinites visiting unfamiliar areas would ask the locals where they could find a "time machine".

True, but you gotta admit... it sounds cooler.
Preferably not on the boat.
Watch out for the cats, theyll push you off the edge.
There not much atmosphere, either
I wondered when the sun would rise. Then it dawned on me.
I dunno, but I think it would make a killer punchline.
you're...Numb nuts.
That's really weird to me because it drops the 'r' like a British accent would but only because it's in the wrong place. I've always thought Boston was more faithful to the old American accent that was somewhat British, perhaps because of its colonial history or subsequent immigration.

Something I did just realise is that Americans pronounce 'ironic' the same as the British (in terms of the placement of the 'r') but pronounce 'irony' differently even though they are obviously etymologically related.

If anyone can be said to be "saying it wrong", it's the yanks (which means Americans but I understand it to mean, in America, those from New England/the North).
Interesting I hadnt thought of that, but it makes sense. Now that I think about it speaking quickly I tend to drop the r entirely- something like eye-ya-knee
Another interesting thing I've observed is that phonetic spelling differs depending on accent unless one uses the phonetic alphabet.

Because accent is relative, sounding out words to foreigners in text doesn't always translate well.
I'm sure Boston adds the 'y' but the main difference is the position of the 'r'. Presumably an American takes the strange rule that creates the pronunciation of 'iron' and applies it to 'irony', even though they aren't etymologically related.
As an American I pronounce iron like i-yurn, and irony like I-yurn-ee, but I have a noticeable Boston accent when I speak and this might be part of that
Like it's spelled, whereas Americans say "iorny". It's a subtle difference but enough that a rhyme doesn't make sense outside of America.

There's also the fact that most non-American accents native to the English language are derivative of the general British accent. As such the 'r' in 'iron' is silent but implied to be after the 'o' (through the inflection on said 'o'), whereas Americans pronounce the 'r' in the same place.

There may not be an exact science to accents but these are my anecdotal findings.
This went over my head because it misses me completely.

You mean... you don't know what 69 is...?
This one got me laughing!
I wondered why the ball kept getting bigger and bigger, then it hit me.
Also it's the pronunciation of "irony" that's fucked up, not "iron".

My point is messy if anything.
I can't actually think of any others
The worst one is how they say aloominum instead of aluminium.

Edit: Typo.
A source that nobody ever beat their wife or wrapped their car around a pole because of smoking too many cigarettes.  The source of the grey sky is from the aliens belly button. 

I guess its just a oneliner joke. Something like Why was 6 afraid of 7?.
Americans and their fucked up pronunciations of metals.
* A 69 is just an eight times an eight plus a high five!

FIFY
Is there a joke here? Is the pun a phrase I've never heard? Have I had a stroke?
What does it have to do with anything though? 
8 x 8 + 5 = 69
Mmm... irony
Huh? 
Second hand smoke is not nearly as dangerous as a dozen other things you're exposed to every day.  Lock yourself in a room with cigarette smoke for a few hours, you'll get a cough.  Try that with the car exhaust you breathe every day and you'll be dead.  Hell, ordinary sunshine is a class A carcinogen.  Let's not act like second hand cigarette smoke is an insta-cancer death monster while we wade around in all sorts of other (worse) shit.  

You want a source for the fact that tobacco doesn't intoxicate people?  Shall I find you a source for the color of the sky while I'm at it?

I think that saying you were pouring a drink implies that you weren't moving, and also that you weren't very drunk.

Some of my best friends are vegans. But as someone in the food industry, whenever a vegan comes and asks for special treatment to meet their dietary convictions, a few of my coworkers have been known to say, "Uuuggghhh, I hate vegans." The vegan didnt do anything wrong, but people often have a beef with them because of their choice of vegan lifestyle.
Ahhh, I guess because I live in Los Angeles and know and work with vegans I've never seen it that way.
People often have a beef with vegans just because they're vegans, which is why the "veganness" would have to be in private.
I don't fuck with nobody.
https://youtu.be/1vOLmh1u7o0
I think it works better as you're only a vegan in public because you don't want to have a beef with anyone, implying you only want beef by yourself.

lol you shoulda made a joke about this because he would have only been a 1 hit wonder 
Escalators can never be out of order, they just temporarily become stairs
 Hmm... that's like saying: If half of my problems are due to my own stupidity, and half of my problems are due to other people's stupidity, a sizable portion could be due to both... LOL. Are you calling me stupid?
But even so, who is to say that the problems solved by this dont intersect? On average you would still only solve 75% of your problems
Charge for it so you can buy more problem solving books. The world will be rid of all disease and war! There will be no more problems!

And if you're a power user you can solve your neighbor's problems too. 
LoL. Good thinking there, but you assume I am going to use them sequentially. The correct way would be to use them concurrently.
But....but.... Say you have a 100 problems. So the first book gets rid of 50, then the next will get rid of 25 out of 50. You will never get rid of problems at this rate!
Insecure toothpaste, basically.
Sensitive toothpaste (toothpaste for sensitive teeth) is for people with sensitive teeth, usually to heat or cold. Sensitive in the case of the title is referring to toothpaste being emotionally sensitive to op using a different toothpaste.

The reception of this one seems a little chilly.
so 'erect a penis' is an anagram for 'rest in peace', there has to be a mourning wood joke in there somewhere.
Could one get way with saying this reverently at a funeral?

Must have got the wrong package. 
I was the same. Didn't start studying untill after I turned 28, no point in getting in to debt untill I find something wlrth getting in to debt for. And I prefer learning on my own, but employers usually want a degree 
I'm not sure

She's definitely not the subject anymore, but there might not be an object in the sentence

I can't remember the analysis now
So would I was left by my girlfriend make her the object? I always struggled with this
I love making self-deprecating jokes, I just wish I wasnt so fucking bad at them.
Enough Iron in your diet?
I'm really not sure about what I want to study in University, but I need to worry about school and the army before (highschool senior now, mandatory army service done time after that)

I hope I can actually learn what I like and not just what can get me a well-earning job, though I currently prefer learning stuff on my own so it might not be too bad
I'm doing it mainly because I like it, and the bachelors degree lets me apply to a masters in things relating to international humanitarian work, which is what I want to end up in
Well not Cunning enough since she left him!
I want to get a degree in it sometime in the future, but it seems quite useless, like most of what interests me
Me too, that's why I'm currently doing my bachelors degree in it 
It's time for someone to address this.
I love linguistics, so I had no choice
You're taking the premise of this one-liner a lot more seriously than me 
Femail Man
In  I treated her like an object., shes the object.  
I laughed a little too much over this one. Sorry not sorry?
In "my girlfriend left me", she is the subject

Stewart Francis did a 9min set for Live at the Apollo. It's on the BBC Facebook page and probably youtube.
Probably one of the easier to remember. To be fair, I may only be able to come up with one or 2 others. It's been a few weeks since I saw this one though. 
The shame is, out of all the great one liners OP stole this one.
Thats not a one liner tho

Even better if you use the UK English spelling of diarrhoea.
Because it is a joke consisting of only one line

OP butchered the joke, I think they meant emoji not emo?

I'd phrase it like this: "If Owen Wilson was checkin' out bulges, would he type wOw instead of OwO?"
Yeah I forgot what it was and emo was the first one I thought haha.
Less emo, more furry?  Wouldn't associate OwO with emos myself...or is that me getting it wrong? I dunno. Like the concept though!

Inspired by your comment, I have consulted the google. 
So its Japanese word for hermaphroditism and in a broader sense androgyny. Also used in porn to describe someone with both male and female sexual characteristics. And I think I gathered that its also an erotic comic genre. Perhaps someone more versed in these matters may have more to add. 
traps are anime boys that look like girls, so they usually don't have breasts at all, and futanaris are anime girls with dicks, usually with gigantic breasts
See, *this* is a one-liner. No set-up, no internal pause, just pure delivery.
nice one!
Im not getting this and since that word looks Japanse, i dont want to Google it
Thanks for that...

Personally I think /r/oneliners should be mainly for like, action hero one-liners, rather than just normal jokes. 

Sure, some jokes are single sentence, but that's not what makes a "one-liner." See, comedy requires timing. The most common rhythm is a simple "Question, Beat, Answer" formula. **What makes a true one-liner is that it skips the "answer" part and ends on the beat.** The "one line" delivers both the set up *and* the punchline, and the all-important beat is provided by your own brain's processing time.

So if you're doing anything to *explicitly* moderate the timing -- any manually inserted "pause" which isn't strictly grammatical -- then it's not a one-liner, it's a question-beat-answer joke.

I don git it. 
I suppose I could've substituted the semicolon with the word "since". 

Or, I could've substituted the semicolon with a colon and then substituted a dash for each of the two subsequent colons. 

Which option do you think would work best? Or, do you have another option?

Dumb. Its preposition and youd be making a proposal not a proposition. 
In Sweden you must drive with your headlights on at all times, not just when its raining.

Paradox
It is. But it is also an object. The two are not mutually exclusive.

"A reflexive pronoun is normally used when the object of a sentence is the same as the subject." [Wikipedia on Reflexive pronouns](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Reflexive_pronoun)
r/twoliners
Its the correct amount of sentences for this sub, yes 
I think that still counts as reflexive 
Really really old joke
Sorry, I guess I should have given a subject to that sentence. You are right, if we assume that the subject is you. What about in "I give that to myself."? I would hardly say "I give that to me."
&gt;	I have CDO, which is like OCD but the letters are in alphabetical order.

Is this the correct amount of sentences for you?
hwy?

 'I have to sort my books!' she cried,  
With self-indulgent glee;  
With senseless, narcissistic pride:

Then left without a peep -  
And washed my hands until they bled,  
And cried myself to sleep.

Wouldn't the correct form be "Give that to me"? 
"Give that to myself."

Would this not be an example of "myself" as an object of a preposition? Not sarcastic, just seeing if it would work.
You mean, like, maybe you came here for a different reason?
Which is sixty seconds I presume?
I is a subject pronoun, myself is a reflexive pronoun.

OP could have moved the comma after ago to get rid of the and entirely.

Fine, let's nitpick.

It's in one line -&gt; it's a one liner.

fite me

And let's look at the sidebar:

&gt;WHAT IS A ONELINER?
A oneliner is a succinct, funny or witty remark. This should all fit into the title.
Generally, if your joke would be more funny if it was split into a title and body section, its probably not a oneliner.

Again, a one liner.
&gt; People who give bad massages rub me up the wrong way.

Fixed

Maybe so, but if we are I'm going to go further. I think having the "as they" or a "because they" makes it not a one-liner as well. It's not just about fitting in one sentence, this style of joke is for pure wordplay-- where a single phrase has a pun embedded in it.

"Shout out to the people wondering what the opposite of in is"
Ok, fine.

"I don't trust stairs as they always look like they're up to something."

At this point, we're nitpicking.
I wouldn't. Any form of punctuation in the middle makes it not a one-liner. To make this joke a one-liner, you'd have to say something like:

"Staircases are always up to something..."
Not **one**liner
ohhhhhh okay i get it now
Messages  Massages
I don't get it
Change the ... with a ; and it's a one liner again. I'd still count it as a one liner.

Umm...no why would it? I don't get the joke. Cap?
You exaggerate more than anyone on the entire planet.
Ugh, this is knot good.
I like the original more because it's not funny until the last two words.
Nah. I'm way more humble than this guy.

I think it would work better if it was "it scares all the passengers in my car"

Still, great joke

Came here for this haha. I was about to say, unless you have the right spot for it, not that high scoring a word. Having somewhere to put the good word is half the battle.
But you can't resist yelling "I have diarrhea" because it runs in your genes.
No 
Up to 167 points .

The letters are worth 12 (1 for i, a, r r, e, and a; 2 for d; 4 for h.) If you play it across two of the triple words then one of the rs is doubled for 13, and then multiply by 9 for 117 points, and then add the 50 bonus points for 167 total.
No because not all the energy it uses is used to make heat.
What if a gunman walks into the room and says first person to yell I have diarrhea is the one who survives? Huh OP? I bet you feel really stupid right now 
Isn't this a Demitri Martin joke??
It's sarcastically profound.
Well the other way to look at it is:
If you're single then it's deep.
If you're in relationship then it's funny.
Here I meant it as a 'verb' and not as a 'noun.'
I'm not sure if this is really funny or really deep.
Outstanding!
Well, no. Efficiency is the ratio of the energy provided to the energy supplied.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, you are correct in that heat is often the largest loss of energy (and therefore efficiency) of a machine. So, your joke makes sense.
Lovely 
Wouldn't a heater be 100% inefficient then?
thats how you dont give her an orgasm
Pun intended
I honestly laughed out loud at this one. At 3 AM. Someone might have woken up
This post is heating
the definition of a machine being inefficient is it creates heat
Heaters arent very efficient.

That's awesome! Watson just wanted some recognition, but he wasn't practical, and probably me too.

Well told. I like the categories reeled off: astronomy, theology, etc.
 Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson decide to go on a camping trip. After dinner and a bottle of wine, they lay down for the night, and go to sleep.

Some hours later, Holmes awoke and nudged his faithful friend.

"Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see."

Watson replied, "I see millions of stars."

"What does that tell you?"

Watson pondered for a minute.

"Astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets."
"Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo."
"Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three."
"Theologically, I can see that God is all powerful and that we are small and insignificant."
"Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow."
"What does it tell you, Holmes?"

Holmes was silent for a minute, then spoke: "Watson, you idiot. Someone has stolen our tent!"
Where's my tent?
What was the original one?
A short variant of the (in)famous Sherlock &amp; Holmes camping joke. It's pretty outdated so I guess it's better to have it as a oneliner now. I DO VALIDATE.

Question mark in the middle of a sentence is an older grammatical form but it checks out.  I suppose technically insomnia shouldn't be capitalized though, so I agree it is two lines.

Are you heterohexual or homohexual?
You'd want to be careful.  It could set off an emotional trauma for the dog and you.  What if the dog wants to contacts its parents?  That could open a whole can of dogfood.  You could be blamed for witholding the information.  The dog may have a traumatic time finding the parents and could be rejected, or get on better with them than with you.  It may also discover it came from a very big litter and have to go searching for them all.  They are just some of the problems, so be careful.

I'm here to kick gum and chew ass, and I'm all out of gum. 
Ive never heard someone say that. 
We have a similar word for sausage, borrowed from German, it sounds the same but spelled wurst
In my mother language (dutch) a worst is actually a sausage. For some reason I forgot how to english for just that word amd I was thinking where a sausage would fit into a joke about bubble gum.
Very nice
You may well have. I thought it up, but I'm not so full of hubris to think that I'm the only, or even the first, to do so. 
Oh trust me i know the joke very well
Its used in Dazed and Confused also as well as many other places. As in Dazed and Confused its im here to fight and drink beer and im all out of beer . Its a very common joke but i mean your line to a exact I feel like i heard it on a podcast maybe not though.Maybe it was some other version of the joke
Here is a full article on why jeans shrink : [https://www.fashionfantzy.com/blogs/news/can-jeans-shrink](https://www.fashionfantzy.com/blogs/news/can-jeans-shrink)
"I'm here to kick ass and chew bubble gum" is from They Live, famously also used in one of the Duke Nukem games. 

This variation on it I came up with, but of course it's entirely possible that I wasn't the first.

They're just two different things.

*Simile: a figure of speech involving the comparison of one thing with another thing of a different kind, used to make a description more emphatic or vivid (e.g., as brave as a lion, crazy like a fox ).*

*Idiom: a group of words established by usage as having a meaning not deducible from those of the individual words (e.g., rain cats and dogs, see the light ).*

I can't think of an example where a simile is also an idiom, but I'm open to hearing of one. 


Are simile and idiom mutually exclusive?

Its not _entirely_ false. As OP put in his comment, its just that they make strong use of prefixes as adjectives, so slushy snow is one word, powdery snow is another, etc.
All names are made up if you really get down to it.
Did the guy who invented patents get a patent?
The snow thingy is entirely false. Urban legend.

&amp;#x200B;
Take you for example ^^^/s
The show Comedy Bang Bang had a one time segment called "You've made your bed, now lie in it" and it was a game show where contestants would quickly make the bed and get in it and they had to tell a lie. Then they had a retired detective assert if they did in fact tell a lie or if they told the truth.

Some contestants would get stressed and accidentally tell a truth and they'd get disqualified.

The segment isn't even that funny but I still laugh whenever I think about it just because of how silly it is to make a whole segment based on such a shitty pun
I think its just that Maam is equal on both sides of the apostrophe.

Thats happened to me many times too, if you came up with it I dont think someone else coming up with it earlier makes you any less funny.
It kills me whenever I think of an original idea, to find it online. But then reassures me that maybe Im still funny. And then there are some jokes I find online that I wish I thought of hah. 
Ah, guess we were not original, but its still funny nonetheless.
It was just posted on r/funny as an image yesterday I think. If you google image that phrase, youll see it. 
Great one. I was watching something and I heard curiosity killed the cat and I instantly thought of the rover killing a cat. You were first so you earn my respect.
Not to mention the fact that Inuit has an abundance of words for everything, since the language makes heavy use of prefixes in place of adjectives. 
I'm not sure I follow. Is this in reference to how British people pronounce "Ma'am" similar to how Americans pronounce "Mom"?
It's Too Short; Didn't read and it's absolutely useless as it takes something too short to be bothered to read and makes it shorter.

Don't you just hate it when that happens 
Additional twist: the sitcom radio comedy Cabin Pressure featuring Benedict Cumberbatch is very good. 
this joke really isnt that impressive when you realize the use of the word pilot in the first place in the TV industry was to allude to the fact that it was meant to bringing it onto the air for the first time (because we actually call it being on air)

Yes.  It's beautiful to gaze at from our oxygenated, atmospheric bubble, but out there, it's very cold and inhospitable to life.
So youre saying outer space sucks?
The original from my youth (I'm nudging 60) was simply "Did you know, for a whole year, I couldn't walk?"

Even **with** that prior knowledge, your joke fails because the extra explanation is completely necessary.

True, so does the original, but that makes the original a two-liner, and yours a three-liner.

A one-liner should be self-contained...you know, in one line.
I completely disagree

-- u/joker54
Ah! Now I get it!! That's actually pretty funny.

Should be 6 miles or 3000 months, imo. 

Edit: looks like the tribe has spoken and my opinion is wrong.  Huh. 
I dont get it.
For some, its a burning problem. 
Stephen Wright wrote the title joke, from his special When the Leaves Blow Away. The rest are mine
Up vote for actually being a one liner. Good job comrade.
Sentences and lines are very different things. Multiple sentences can collectively take up less than one line (ex. "Hi. How are you?"), or one sentence can take up many lines (ex. "Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsbys house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.").
Actually it kinda does. One Line.
A one-liner is defined as "a short joke or witty remark". It doesn't have to be only a single sentence.
Good point, but keep digging.
Underrated comment t right here
Upvote, for actual one-liner.
Careful though. If you sell one and it dies in transit, it might come back to haunt you. 
nice one :)

But thats not the point of this sub. This sub is about one line jokes. BY DEFINITION a period ends a sentence.

Love it. 
I see what youre saying and it IS pretty simple. But I kinda feel like a line isnt defined by punctuation. A lot of one liner comedians jokes are two sentences. Quick, concise, and right to the punch. Set em up, knock em down. 
The defense is increasing
Shazammmn son! 
Abraca-damn!

Oh hang on. I just saw my typo! Give me ANY upvote you like. Or none at all. Literally. 
No, YOU have an upvote. Another one, I mean. 
It's heart rendering.
besides I only exaggerate like once every million years
Any upvote. Ha. Here, have an upvote.
Give or take?
[deleted]
I was going to say that! Have any upvote.
Hyperbole literally annoys me to death.
You should be using a conjunction when you use a comma though, which makes the whole sentence flow smoothly and is a one liner.

A semi-colon  serves the same purpose as a period, but it implies the two clauses have a linkage; honestly it's no real difference as you have two separate thoughts loosely associated and you just made it look fancy and removed the conjunction.
It is a full stop with emphasis however.  Functionally an exclamation point, a question mark, and an interrobang are no different from a period.
People who are baited into replying are equally stupid. 
You forgot the word "literally." 
Only Siths deal in absolutes
YES!!!! I swear nobody my age knows who he is! 
Surely you mean A pedant, right? Psh, what a idiot...
But we will upvote them.
Yeah, a lot could be reworked to be shorter and maybe then a comma will be all that's needed
I think everyone who generalizes are idiots!
BRO
Three dots are also a shape 
Broom swept.
No, everyone does.  
But I think often the joke includes too many words. If the author just switched then around and used a comma they'd be much better. 
That's an ellipsis. An ellipse is a shape. 
Steven Wright. What a mind!
Hmm, I'm gonna need at least three links to scholarly articles for that one.
If you replace the period with a coma it's still a two-liner. Now it just has bad grammar. Most of the two liners I see posted can be easily rephrased to work
This really Musk not happen !
Only brits and Americans who watch the premier league will get this one
/r/threeliners ^^^^(just ^^^trying ^^^to ^^^be ^^^funny)
If there are TOO MANY periods, shed better restock the tampons!
Youre right its total pedantry, but thats why we have rules in the first place isnt it? I get that its normal in speech to have a pause, which could easily be denoted by a comma or a semicolon or any number of other glyphs that arent periods or full stops or any number of other names they might be called. My point is that one line is defined by a period. That seems pretty basic if you ask me. 
&gt;they're just as dashing

Ftfy
If use of a full stop means a better delivery, even when it could be just one line with a comma... It really doesn't matter.

Surely the point is for those tiny, quip like jokes?

Who's got time on their hands to care in what manner the clauses are parsed?
Actually please don't just replace the period with a comma. I'd honestly prefer a two liner than these dumb comma splices
If you do not understand this joke without having it explained, then well..there you go. 
Fair enough. Lol I did use an ellipse. 

I meant if there is one period, there is one sentence. 
C'mon, it's Smokey, man! He was a conscientious objector!
An exclamation point is not a period.
Thats called an ellipse.
Finally someone said something. I was too afraid of the downvote brigade to do it. 
Wouldnt this actually be....if theres more than one period?
I don't get why people are so keen to get on r/oneliners. There are other subs for jokes that aren't one line. If you're being really strict about it you could also say any joke with a riposte is a two liner, poetically.
This isn't 'nam Dusty, there are rules.
My Grandpa just passed away. We're grateful he went peacefully in his sleep. Can't say the same for the rest of the people on his bus. 
Is there a difference between periods and dots though? And what if we use exclamation points?
Not really a one liners but it was still funny
If there's a period in your title you might be Princess On The Rag.
You can also use emdashes  theyre just as good!

A big part of the concern is that priests have a very intimate position of trust and work closely with children in a private setting. This is why you don't have the same level of scrutiny for say accountants, or carnies.

Lets see how much you like it when someone cracks a joke about your dead family member before they are even buried.
Yea, but the priest scandal got more media coverage because everyone wants to see the church go down for some reason.
If people weren't so uppity and easily offended they could actually learn to appreciate a light hearted (and non offensive) joke surrounding one of the most influential people of our time. 
Disrespectful how? Did I say she was a terrible person? Am I degrading her as a person? 
You shouldn't joke about such things so soon. People are really torn up about this.

https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2017/12/15/its-not-about-celibacy-blaming-wrong-thing-sexual-abuse-church
  
&gt; Experts disagree on the rate of sexual abuse among the general American male population, but Allen says a conservative estimate is one in 10. Margaret Leland Smith, a researcher at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says her review of the numbers indicates it's closer to one in 5. 

That's, at a minimum, a rate of 10% among the general population. The highest estimate of accused (not even convicted, just accused) priests was 4%, a few decades ago. 

Which means the rate of abusers among the general male population is 2 to 5 times greater than that among the celibate priesthood. 
Alching yourself is kinda like purifying yourself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka, just making yourself a better person. 
But I hope whatever you have going on in your life sir "cunty" turns around and you find what makes you happy. You seem upset.

"I SHOULD'VE BROKE YOUR BACK" 

Jefe: We have many beautiful piatas for your birthday celebration, each one filled with little surprises!

El Guapo: How many piatas?

Jefe: Many piatas, many!

El Guapo: Jefe, would you say I have a plethora of piatas?

Jefe: A what?

El Guapo: A plethora.

Jefe: Oh yes, El Guapo. You have a plethora
.
El Guapo: Jefe, what is a plethora?

Jefe: Why, El Guapo?

El Guapo: Well, you just told me that I had a plethora, and I would just like to know if you know what it means to have a plethora. I would not like to think that someone would tell someone else he has a plethora, and then find out that that person has no idea what it means to have a plethora.

Jefe: El Guapo, I know that I, Jefe, do not have your superior intellect and education, but could it be that once again, you are angry at something else, and are looking to take it out on me?
"You deserve this. Also sorry I broke your arm."

and just because others have done it doesnt make it right. We just need better moderation.
Yeah, there isn't a good subreddit to post to and I have seen ones with punch lines before.
You put two off(s).
Its a funny riddle, but its literally two lines.
Its two sentences, sure, but it fits the spirit of this sub rather perfectly.
R.I.P My aunt died in a thunderstorm too, she had an iron stomach. 
For a second I was wondering what kind of kinky subreddit I subscribed to in my weed-fueled haze last night lol.
Yeah OP could easily have formatted this to be one line.
Well, that's what it's all about,  innit?
2 liner
this is actually perfect as a pick-up line. 

Babe, is your name Medusa? 'Cause you're making me hard just looking at you
It's alright my man. Stuff happens.
Gone is better than Never. I agree.
I dont feel the juggling or the 'period' was meant to be looked at separately. 

Some context, in conversation with person, she rambles on about her friends relationship and the on/off Boyfriend. So i jokingly said to introduce me, i was again told about the on/off boyfriend. So i said thats fine and unleashed my op. 

I changed the beginning for the post as originally it was "thats fine... when he is on i will be off, when i am on he will be off and when she is one we will both be off"  

I hope that clears it up :) 

Your alternative certainly makes it more clear and obvious, i like it. I think i prefer 'gone' instead of 'never' at the end. It does fit with the sex life being gone when that time of the month comes. 

Anyways. Thank you 


Maybe try something a little less complicated? Like I was trying to figure out why she was juggling two boyfriends and that wasn't even really part of the joke.   If you really want to make a period joke, maybe something like...

"My girlfriend and I have a very on-again off-again sex life. When we are on-again, its great. When we are off-again, its not. But when shes on-again its never. Period."

Best I could do.
Its all i got :( 
Thats what you are going for?
On her period...

Stop being so sensitive. 
It's very okay. You're just too sensitive. 
Well, in case you missed  the joke, the nut holding the wheel can be the driver, so yeah cause of most accidents, if not all
not original content but funny nonetheless
Why are we downvoting this? It's still a slur. "Language" can have meaning, believe it or not, and using a derogatory term for a marginalised group of people really isn't something you should be promoting. Telling people they're sensitive for being offended at something that's *gasp* offensive is one of the worst things you can do.
It's deconstructing language, not calling anyone anything. The term itself isn't exactly used kindly in many settings, but I can personally guarantee that there are people who identify as tranny because to them accepting the word is a form of combating the harmful usage of it. They and I recommend that you not demand the world to abide by the rules of your safe space, and don't let words rule you. There is no point in this joke where a specific way of life is stated as lesser to another, the hatred you're feeling is all coming from your interpretation of the word. 

Language is fluid and changes, mostly getting shortened. Tranny came from transformer, but it also came from transvestite. That's the joke. Nobodies car broke because I said that, and nobodies way of life is devalued from my saying it. 
The government is totalitarian, cutting and censoring internet, attacking and killing protesters who are mainly young students 
Right? Like, I know the word tranny is offensive. I wouldn't call someone a tranny. But shit man this joke made me chuckle. 
I dont like the term, but I still find it funny. Sorry this world isnt perfect for you.
Grow a funny bone you thin skinned fuck. 
[deleted]
Really? 
I understand it's not your sense of humor. However, because it has positive upvotes at this time and your comment has negative, I'll assume the consensus is that even with not politically correct terminology people still think it's funny. I know I do.
Not an ok term, not an ok joke. 

EDIT: Lots of opinions on here, but the fact is that tranny is a hateful slur for someone that is not cissexual. If you can replace that word with one of the others for marginalized groups that went out of style decades ago, its not ok. Im not angry, just standing up for people this refers to.

Kind of. That meme is a play on the belief of the trinity. Same as this joke. 
A major part of Christianity that seperates it from other Abrahamic religions is the Trinity. The belief that God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are all one God, yet still separate.

Google can explain it better, but at its core it is a logical impossibility and hence something you simply must believe in without understanding.

Edit: think of the Trinity as a cube. God is the mass - the entirety - of the cube, invisible. The three Persons (father, son, holy ghost) are like different faces of the cube - all equally the cube but still distinct.
Yeah he is, or whatever. I was raised Catholic and I couldn't tell you exactly. But I think it's a play on that meme of Jesus praying and it reads "dear god, it's me, you"
I believe the idea is that you're not supposed to be able to understand it as a mere mortal. You just kind of have to accept it cause it's church doctrine.
It doesnt make any sense tbh. Ive spoken to Christians who argue that he is both God himself and the son of god. I cant understand the trinity 
Is this joke supposed to work on the premise that Jesus is God?

I always thought Jesus was the son of God.
I guess he used the wrong account.

I called my mother and told her about how my wife never listens and then I went shopping, spending money I dont have on stuff I dont need for people I dont like then I got a call from Gary whos my BFF but I hate him because he can eat anything he wants without gaining a pound but if I just look at a piece of cake it goes straight to my ass and then I went to return some of the stuff I bought earlier but the guy behind the counter wouldnt take it because I didnt have the receipt even though I was just there, like, 7 hours ago but I know hes just being an asshole because he remembered me from high school and that time I gave him a back handed compliment that he totes deserved because he told Mike who told Frank who told me that I was getting a little slow on the field but if that was even remotely true we wouldnt have made it to state because I totally carried our field hockey team all the way no thanks to Trevor, who everyone knew was sleeping with Giselle, but he wouldnt admit it because shes totally a moped and speaking of mopeds, some asshole on a moped (really a big loud Sons of Anarchy kind of motorcycle, but whatevs because omg Jax is one I would totally go gay for)  cut me off when I changed lanes without signaling almost making me spill my grande java mocha frap on my lap and oops didnt mean to, but I totally rhymed right now because Im totally a poet and I know it because my friend Max said that I should go on Americas got talent and that I would destroy the competition with my mad word skills because I really dont talk a lot but when I do you know its gonna be something special because my wife says Im deep, like an ocean and I totally wanted to tell her the same thing but I know she wouldve taken it all out of context and made a big deal out of nothing like she says I always do which I do know isnt true, because if it was true I would not have gone to my doctor for these fucking mood swings and need to make catty comments to everyone and be totally snarky with everyone even though they low key dont deserve it but Im totally secure in my manhood even though my doctor said I have levels of estrogen in my body but yall know doctors dont know shit anyway because I looked online and saw that that cant really happen because Chris Martin said Gwyneth Paltrow told him that high levels of estrogen in men cause catty comments, snarkiness and talkative behavior which I totes dont have, amirite boys?

one of my favorite things to do is trolling people at the gym. My favorite water bottle combo has to be hersheys chocolate syrup bottle for intra workout, squirt mayonaise bottle for protein, and 40oz vodka bottle with the stickers ripped off as a water bottle. sometimes I'll sit in the sauna and offer people swigs of my water. sometimes I'll forget the syrup bottle on the treadmill or whatever, shower and get dressed, then go back to the treadmill and ask the person using it "is this yours?"  and when they say no, I grab it, chug it empty, and walk out. 

I work out in the AM and one time my personal trainer told me that he was going to be 30 mins late; so I bought chicken wings across the street and sat on the spin bike spinning HARD while killing a 1/2 pound of wings.

Repost. I saw this joke literally yesterday.
Yeah, and you could probably cut the version I wrote down by a third at least - the important part is to put the audience in the frame of mind where they're picturing a baptism that would involve immersion in a font (as not all Christian denominations do this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism#Christian_traditions)

Looking at that Wikipedia link, it's got a photo of a large font used for adult baptisms; that seems like it'd probably work as the start of a tighter version.
OK, nice reworking, better flow of story and punchline. Like it. I had only gotten as far as the pun and took the shortest route to a joke. I can see that it is better to let the idea age for awhile to grow some whiskers.
Okay, here's a better version of the joke that implicitly communicates this:

"My nephew was a *big* baby. His parents took him to be baptized, but the priest wasn't able to submerge his whole body. Apparently, he should have picked a bigger font size."

[deleted]
There are (at least) three terms for three different kinds of average:

 * mean = add the numbers up and divide by how many you have

 * median = put them in order and take the value of the middle one

 * mode = put them in a bar chart and take the value of the highest bar

Depending on the collection of numbers you have, they can come out pretty close or be very, very different. For example, median average wealth can seem pretty high, especially in a time like now when there are so many super-wealthy people. But mode or median average wealth is much, much lower - even negative in places where people tend to carry a lot of debt.

(I leave it to someone else to make a mode pun. Anyone who can make one with median deserves gold imho.)
A "mean" is a mathematical average
Wonder if you have vehement reasons? You know. Intensive purposes? 
I'm not sure but I think it has to do with the "mean" being another term for average

Whatever had this high cost of living.

"Despite it being expensive, people still live there. "

Vs 

"Despite it being expensive, people still like it. "
Instead of a high "cost of living", it's the "high cost of" living. It turns the phrase on its head to mean that being alive remains popular.
Sorry, not getting it. "What" still remains popular? 
Popular = there's some population

That Buddha's first name? Albert Einstein 
"My name's Sam Sara," says the vendor. "Or is it Sara Sam? I forget. Sam Sara Sam Sara."

Buddha thinks, "this vendor's just going round in circles"
"That's nun of my concern" says Buddha 
I am the bus driver! replied the vendor.
This triggered my kundalini
Imo its pretty basic common knowledge. Most people (Id assume) would get this joke.
Thank you (not sent from my iPhone).

"Change is inevitable, except from a vending machine".
"Do you know who I am?!" yells the vendor, getting quite upset. Buddha tightens his finger on the trigger and says "Enlighten me"
the vendor refuses to give him his change back, so the buddah whips out a gun from his robe and points it at the man. The vendor says "What the heck is that??" The buddah says "this is my inner piece."

Don't feel bad, [you're not alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJhKVICLi9s).
Then Buddha paid for his hot dog with a hundred dollar bill, and asked for change. The vendor said "Change comes from within"
Here's the version I'm familiar with: 

Question: What did Krishnamurti say to the hot dog vendor?

Answer: "Make me one with everything"
well, as jokes go, that expects maybe a bit too much prior knowledge of the recipient. but maybe among fellow Buddhists, it's a showstopper...

a fat man called 'Joe' prayed every day to Jesus: "*please Lord, bless me, and make me perfect and beautiful, and please also give me the body of a young God...*" and then one day he heard a BOOMING voice from Heaven "**Joe, just become a Buddhist!**"

The power of the apostrophe, delineated by a comical notion. "my pet hate's"; my pet hate _is_ being poked in the eye. My pet hates being poked in the eye too.
Comical to me, because I doubt there are many who actually like to be poked in the eye and ordinarily one would not need to specify that they hate being poked in the eye.
Seemingly the same sentence but the words change meaning completely by the simple use of an apostrophe. My (as in me) pet hate (single most hated thing) _is_ being poked in the eye. (same words again without apostrophe) my pet hates being poked in the eye (as it sounds, but now the same words in the same sentence without the apostrophe take on a new meaning and refer to another entity). Not side splitting, I grant you that. 
Hmmmm, the plot thickens.

Why would the person repairing them set the time? The person repairs and then you can set the time 
No
Just think, you could have climbed the corporate ladder.
I can't upvote this because it's at 256
fair enough, fair enough.
Yes but the clocks themselves would be wrong. If op asked a repairer, then they would know the time, but they did not.
[deleted]
but whoever's repairing the clock would need to know what to set the clocks to when they're fixed
The clocks were being repaired so they would be broken and wrong.
Does Demitri Martin have any other good lines, SQLDave?
You'd think the one place that would always know what time it is would be the repair shop for things that tell time but whatever works for you

Better as a yo mama joke:. Yo mama so stupid she put lipstick on her head just to makeup her mind.
If anyone cares for etymology that kills the joke, here you go:

Unfortunately, pro is not the opposite of con. "Con-" as in congress, convention or consequence is a prefix form of the latin "cum", which means "together (with)". In this sense it is used in congress: "-gress" being the participle of the latin "gradi" (to walk), "con-" meaning together, congress refers to a group of people who came together.

"Pro" means both for and forward; its opposites are thus "contra" (against) and "re-" or "retro" (back or again).

The "contra" lives forth in the english prefix counter- (-argument, -attack, -clockwise), and it has also been used to designate arguments against something (pro and contra), then been shortened to just con, and so this misconception and joke have come to be.

The prefix "re-" as well as the preposition "retro" have also found use, often through the middle step of a latin word being included in english, for example in (E-)Mail where a REsponse is designated "Re: ".  
Another example is the actual opposite of progress, which is formed by prefixing "-gress" with the opposite prefix, thus forming regress, which was probably predictable by now.

But that's not very funny, except maybe the first paragraph if you're inclined towards sex jokes (literally: if you lean that way).

Here is a fact about Chuck Norris: 

 &gt;Chuck Norris is the only human being to display the Heisenberg uncertainty principle - you can never know both exactly where and how quickly he will roundhouse-kick you in the face.
It's not uncommon for "one-line" jokes to have an implied, rather than explicit, punchline. The idea is that the line is funnier if it *doesn't* spell out the answer for you.

Its technically not a oneliner, but i think its close enough to call it one. Hes still right though
I disagree, but I still dont think the joke should be here, given that its older than congress itself.
[deleted]
Right and the person filling it in in their head is the second line of the joke. It's just implied by the original speaker, but it's still there and necessary to complete the joke.
Not necessarily. People can fill it in themselves. In fact, most times Ive heard this joke, people dont say the punchline, they let others figure it out in their head. 
And live in your diening room?
But a one liner means the set up and the punchline within a single sentence. This joke has the set up in a question form which requires a second sentence, the response to the question, to complete the joke. The question whats the opposite of progress? Is not the punchline of the joke. 
Im with ya buddy. This definitely isnt a oneliner, no matter how bad OP wants it to be. They didnt format it that way. They coulda, but they didnt. Its especially egregious because weve ALL heard this joke before, and OP Is just stubborn.
I watched that episode yesterday lmao
But that's not funny when said like that. It's better to let the listener figure it out on their own, since enough information is provided in the line to do so. Providing the punchline is like explaining the joke, which ruins any joke. So this is a perfect one liner since the punchline shouldn't be said. 
Pro and con are opposites, 

that fact is clearly seen. 

If progress means to move forward, 

then what does congress mean?


Nipsey Russell

Nice one, Gallagher
Good bot 
If pro is the opposite of con, what is the opposite of progress?

Congress

Thats the joke. Its two lines. 

If pro is the opposite of con then the opposite of progress is Congress. 

Thats the one line version of this joke. 
But it is? You working out the punchline based on the logic provided by the one liner is what makes it funny. That's how humour works. Reordering the logic of a statement to have it make sense.
I agree. The whole joke isn't in one line. OP requires an answer for the joke to be complete and make sense.
Because the punchline of the joke is not in the sentence... 
Jesus heck pls no

Well, this joke is about par for the sub. 
here are 30-odd observations about having a Great Dane, so you can build a few oneliners yourself:

visitors enter the house holding their privates protectively

the pizza delivery people tell you to meet them at the end of the sidewalk

you have given up on water dishes and you just use the bathtub

you have to move over when brushing your teeth because your dog wants a drink

it takes 3 people to get your dog on the scale at the vets

you go to vacuum your car and most of the fur is up there on the ceiling

you purchase a large screen TV and you still can't see the program when he stands in front of the television

the sound of running water makes you jump up and yell, "OUTSIDE!"

your dog can hide an entire tennis ball (among other things) fully inside his lips and give you that innocent look that says, "What? I'm not eating anything!"

you avoid the dogs on your way out the door, so they won't smear your makeup

you walk your dog and everyone knows him by name, but you have no idea who these people are

you keep at least one color-coded "drool towel" in every room of your house

you've learned to force a smile when asked "do you have a saddle for that thing?"

your dane strolls through the living room and everyone jumps to secure things to the coffee table.

after banishing your husband, the snoring in your bedroom still keeps you awake

while stopped at a stop light, everyone stares as your car rocks back and forth because the dog is panting out the window

the donuts you put on top of the refrigerator are gone when you get home and your dog has powdered sugar on his nose

you take your dog for a ride and he rests his head on your arm, causing you to make random right turns

your veterinarian has been able to put in a swimming pool, build a large home, buy jet skis and a personal plane

the monthly dog budget exceeds your home mortgage payment

you show a picture of your dogs and kids together, and the first person you point out is your dog

your dog can see what you're cooking, and he tries to assist you in the preparation

after surgery, your bored pup decides to get up and cruise around the vet's office-- pulling the rolling IV stand behind him

you can carry on a conversation with a dog's muzzle firmly in your crotch

you are hiking with a friend who later suggests that you ought to have an environmental impact statement done on your dog

you toss your dog a ball and cringe when he almost hits his head on the top of the doorway

your dog stands in your lap and reaches over you to stick his head in the drive-through window at MacDonald's and nearly gives the cashier a heart attack when she turns around to give you your change

you carry a tape measure with you when shopping for a new vehicle

you have had to train your dog not to lick dishes, and the dishes are in the sink

your two dogs decide to play in the house, and they end up pulling the ceiling fan down -- for the second time

you have to hide your food in the microwave because that is the only place your dog can't get to it.

I always heard: How do you get your girlfriend to stop smoking? Slow Down. 

It's not a one-liner, so I'd assume you tweaked it from that. Both are good, I can't pick which one I like more.
I couldn't remember if this was a Dimitri Martin joke or a Mitch Hedberg one. They're both so funny and have excellent one-liners

Edit: I just listened to the Steven Wright album that has this joke in it. Whoops.
Bravo
Why?
THIS IS THE BEST POST ON THIS SUB

Lawyer takes Czech friend to hunt.
Friend gets swallowed whole by a bear...
Lawyer calls sheriff, who brings a sharpshooter, who looks through his scope: "Sir, I see two bears, male and female. I can hit one for sure, but the other might then run off. Which do you want?"

Sheriff looks at lawyer... lawyer says, "He's in the male!"

*shoots*

Male falls, female runs off to the woods.
The three run over... cut up the male bear, and find....nothing!
Moral of the story?

Shrimp is also called prawns in many other parts of the world. And jumbo prawns or tiger prawns make a lot more sense.
Okay first of all this isnt how Anthony Bourdain said it- second of all putting quotes on this sentence people would complain that I got an AB quote wrong and third of all Ive been a fan of AB for years and years and years and years and not intently on his mainstream success but rather as an authentic human being who Ive met personally in Nashville at a party. So please, spare me the bullshit - if youre gonna assume Im an asshole Im going to assume your one so dare I say it; you probably didnt give two fucks until he died.

I possess much to speak of my recently obtained book of synonyms.

Incorrect. "who sometimes prepares my food" is not a nonrestrictive clause. It can be in certain sentences, but in this case it is clearly integral to the sentence. It's being used in the sense of "one of the various cooks who prepares sandwiches" not "one of the cooks, who happens to occasionally prepare sandwiches"
It's missing commas.

"I saw one of the cooks, who sometimes prepares my sandwiches, in the bathroom today".

With commas included the meaning is clear. 
Yeah. This is a misplaced modifier error, not punctuation
No, this sentence is correct punctuation wise. This is why word order matters
If that's how you are, then sure.

As a proud member of /r/ben ... no, we really don't. It's pretty easy to stretch a single word across multiple notes; some SATB music is even *designed* to do this on some of the parts (often soprano+alto or soprano+treble).

The problematic case are when you try to cram multiple syllables into a single note. Some 3-syllable names barely work if the middle syllable is naturally weak, but others don't (e.g. Christina, which has a strong second syllable), and of course 4+-syllable names are hopeless.

You are the worst time traveler ever. Telling an old joke, in the future. 
None of us are as dumb as all of us.

No.
If I replace all the periods with. commas in any joke does it become a one liner?

Or if you mix kale with coconut oil, it's easier to scrape into the trash.
That sounds tasty
Shut the heck up. If you bake it with some oil and salt so it becomes crispy it is actually addicting.
I love blending kale and other veggies into smoothies though!
Fair. I've never really liked the taste of raw kale, but I could see how people like it. I just prefer it stir-fried.
Idk man I just eat handfuls of kale raw. It's not amazing, but it's okay and it's so good for you.

Everybody brightens our lives.  Some when they come into it, the rest when they leave.
It's still two lines really though, it's the whole "statement then a punchline" thing that makes it not a one liner.

Edit: brain fart spelling
Should have used a comma I guess 
For that example, consider the sentence "this bed looks slept-in".

Here, "slept" is no longer a verb but a (compound) adjective (as all verbs can become) with the help of the particle. Without the particle, the sentence would be nonsense. And there's no noun at all, so "in" can't be preposition.

(note: the hyphen in compound adjectives is (usually) optional when it's a predicate adjective like this, whereas it would be mandatory in the phrase "slept-in bed")

***

Most, if not all, prepositions can be used as particles with at least some verbs. The verb "to be" can make particles out of most prepositions. A good hint is "is there a (possible obscure or even foreign) single-word synonym that has the same meaning?" Alternatively, try to say it in infinitive form.

For example, "look for" has "seek", "look at" has "observe", and "be on top of" has "cover". Note that synonyms don't have to preserve the *exact* meaning (which is often shaded by connotation anyway).

The classic "prepositions are not for ending sentences with" is almost certainly wrong (analysis is often ambiguous), because there is a direct object and thus "end-with" still has an unchanged sense of "end". "With" still has meaning in conjuction with "end" in general (consider "David ended Goliath with a sling") ... although since it can be removed in *this* case, it might just be the same as the following.

One case that is unambiguously wrong is "Where are you at?", despite the general tendency for "to be" to turn position-related prepositions into adverb-like particles. Here, "at" can be removed with no change in intended meaning, so it's clearly not a particle.

In general, however: most cases where a preposition can't be used as an adverb-like particle simply don't come up, because they sound too wrong in the first place.
r/twoliners
I was thinking that too, not sure which one works best
Same goes for pregnancy
or evangelist, as in a preacher
&gt;whoosh.

Whoosh!
"evangelical" or "evangelist" gotta pick one lol, nice joke though other wise
It does work both ways. It's "they take things literally" not "they take puns literally".
Umm askshuly it's evangelicalistosophers
Perhaps I have a limited understanding of the language \(I am after all a non\-native speaker\), but I'm still having a hard time processing your point. Could you provide any examples of invalid usages of preposition stranding?

E.g. in the sentence "this is the bed I slept in", it doesn't seem to me like the preposition is used as an adverbial particle and yet it's listed as a valid example.
No.
If I can prove people laugh will you change that tune?
This is just wonderful.
Evangelicals
It wasn't funny the first time.
**Grammatical particle**

In grammar the term particle (abbreviated PTCL) has a traditional meaning, as a part of speech that cannot be inflected, and a modern meaning, as a function word associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning.

All those examples are [(adverbial) particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_particle), even if it doesn't call them that.

Not every textbook acknowledges that particles exist in English, but even a cursory glance at the language demonstrates the phenomenon exists, so might as well use the word.
Its much more clever if it works both\(all\) ways.

I know. I didn't mean it as a rehash but rather as an update to the joke that gives it a better second meaning than simply taking a pun literally.
I am on reddit almost 5\+ times a week and I have had an account for 4 years and I never heard this joke before. I like this variation better anyway. You can't literally take a pun. But you can literally take a bible. Both ways.
It's a rehash of a joke that appears on Reddit at least once a week: 
"It's hard to explain puns to kleptomaniacs because they always take things literally."
evangelicalists or evangelicals ?

I think this is the funnest one liner I ever read.
Turtlefeet should be turtlenecks for your feet
[This page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preposition_stranding) doesn't list any of the usages as incorrect. Is there a particular reason why you think it's only right to use preposition stranding in the way you describe (i.e. open interrogatives)?
Eh ... likely all the cases where it's allowed are really just particles which act as adverbs.

E.g. in the question "what are you looking for?", there is no preposition.
I know. I am adding that to the original line because OP never mentioned it. False advertising!
That's really a shower thought...
I think it would come out better if you used "dressed" so as to keep the same amount of syllables
Corrected version: The doctor told me to reduce the amount of sex i had so i married my girlfriend 
I don't know where she got that from
The reality is that a proposition can not contain the subject of the sentence...


Don't want to shit on your parade, because your joke is pretty good, but [you can, tho](https://redd.it/64pcpr)

**DunningKruger effect**

In the field of psychology, the DunningKruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein people of low ability have illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority derives from the metacognitive inability of low-ability persons to recognize their own ineptitude; without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.

Conversely, highly competent individuals may erroneously assume that tasks easy for them to perform are also easy for other people to perform, or that other people will have a similar understanding of subjects that they themselves are well-versed in.

Just because you're telling a narrative, doesn't make it a one liner. The fact it has a "punch line" means it has more than one line. Just take your ass old repost joke somewhere else.
[deleted]
There are no quotes so it's hard to tell, but "they told me" is one speaker and "I" is another. You see? 

Even if it's been written to be a monologue, there is a statement and riposte, which in joke terms makes it two lines imho. Even your Colin's dictionary says it has to be one or the other.

Wouldn't "only" work too?
I think this is a great one liner, but, IMO, it has to be read, rather than told, to appreciate the difference in the word "to." 

Unless, a line is added at the end which said 'spelled "T-O"', followed by the biggest grin you can imagine.

i know I'm super late to this but W.T.F. is an initialism, not an acronym. Acronyms are pronounced like a word such as NASA or RADAR. Initialism is the term for something where you pronounce each letter like WTF, FBI, CIA, etc.

If the trucks were towed to you, you'd be a picked up pickup artist
To be fair, before 0 was standardised the roman numerals were in full swing, the arabs put 1 2 etc, but the number 0 was only adopted after about 200 years after the introduction of the rest of the numbers. The need had appeared when 1002 and 12 were written the exact same way, and if you miss the context the numbers made no sense. So, you might say the inventor was a hard headed, forgetful piece of mathematically genius to a zero sum game.

Someone calls the cops, and tells the Budda to run. He says, "Na, I'mma stay."
Roar you sure?
Came here to post this.
then he said no seriously where the fuck is my fucking change?!

And the vendor said hey man what about inner piece?

And he pulls out a pistol from his robe and says this is my inner piece!
So the Buddha pulls a gun on the vendor. The vendor says "whoa man, what about inner peace?!" To which the Buddha replies, "this is my inner piece."

Here it is
And the cycle continues

Here, Ill set another so you can get an even number comment.
This is quality 
No
I don't feel like I'm generalizing, I've made literally no assumptions about you and you literally said you were judging them, but I apologize, it wasn't my intention to make you feel judged unfairly for judging people unfairly 

Edit: That might have been a bit snarky, sorry 
 Breaking the law! Breaking the law! 
There are always exceptions. I feel that you are actually judging me more than I've judged "those people." Lots of hasty generalizations here. Let's leave it at that. 
I use it figuratively all the time, plenty of very clever people I know use it like that. Do you not use any word that people you don't like use, even if it's used correctly? You must not use many words then. Although there are some Austronesian languages with really cool taboo word systems, so I guess you can do it too 

I also use emojis (as you can see), because I like how they can represent prosodic elements in instanteous written communcation. I also sometimes use the word "hashtag" in spoken communcation because I think it's an interesting and efficient way to mark proverbial use, and is simmilar to the topic marker found in Japanese and Korean. And I gurantee you that literally all my professors and classmates would roll their eyes at someone being snobbish about the "correct" use of the word "literally" 

Just because someones use of language differs from yours, does not make it bad. The people you are judging still communicate efficently with eachother and who knows, maybe they're doing something cool/good/better that we should all be doing 
Forgot /s didnt you?
Sarcasm is sarcastic, get used to it. 
I appreciate this clarification, but have you seen the people who tend to use it as figuratively as of late?  Yeah, I'm judging...
And yet, you still got upvotes. I'm confused too.

...I would rather have upvotes, so I shouldnt have posted this.
Wait, what? Every other comment gets negative karma, I must not know the patterns of this thread.
Why are you getting downvotes? I dont see any trolling here; it was a serious comment and the If you missed it... could bewell, I think thats the fault. Its so mainstream Im sure that One_Winged_Rook got it, and just found it unappealing.
The same word having opposite meaning is called an auto-antonym, like "fast" meaning to not move in "hold fast" or move quickly in "run fast", or the verb "dust" which means to both add and remove fine particles to something. Furthermore (fancy word, so you know I'm totes ma-goats serial) "literally" has been used as a hyperbolic intensifier for literally hundreds of years, longer than people have been annoyed at its misuse. Hope that helped 

Credentials: Studying linguistics
I literally meant that figuratively.
Language changes, get used to it. Lunch used to be slang for luncheon, yet now Lunch is in the dictionary.

Furthermore, [many famous writers also used literally as figuratively](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/misuse-of-literally)

The point of dictionaries is not to prescribe the usage of language. They simply describe how it is used today.
Ha
This makes me so upset. Come on, Merriam Webster! You're just going to let these ignorant kids who misuse the word call the shots? So, now this one word has two definitions that are polar opposites? I can't even look at you anymore...

Who else read this in a Scottish accent?
This sounded really stupid at first, but then it made me pause.
Ihh 
I hardly ever pronounce the t if its at the end of the word, its called a glottal stop 
only if you were brother husbands for at least a short time.
W.T.F is an acronym?
Missing the t is actually common in a few accents, my Scottish accent being one of them. T isnt the only letter either, google the glottal stop.
You're righ
Listen to any Scottish person talk and you'll realise that the letter t isn't all that important most of the time

The pH scale doesn't actually go only to 14... It's a logarithmic scale which theoretically goes as high as you want. But I enjoyed the joke! Thank you
Did you mean "basic"
I give this one liner two things up.  Excellent use of meme, with just a hint of sage aftertaste.
Over 9,000 is neutral, not base
In what sense? Not knowing that the PH scale only goes to 14? Or because the age reference of that pop culture reference is that of someone who should be in school age cohort? 

Please elaborate.

If you missed it, the reference was Dragon Ball Z

In high school history class had a end of term true or false quiz with 100 questions covering the terms coursework. Some of the question were ridiculously easy and would have been known by most kids not even doing history (e.g. Paris is the capital of France), most needed some knowledge from the coursework and some needed extensive knowledge of the coursework.

No one in the class got 100%, a couple 90+%, most 50+% and a small handful under 30%. However one girl got 0% and she answered every question. The teacher was awestruck.

You might understand this if you speak French. But, if you were born and raised in France, you probably won't think this is funny. Why? French generally don't appreciate jokes making fun of their language. In other words, this joke, to some French people, might seem insensitive to their culture. But, the OP might not understand this.

I wonder how they asked it. It only really works if the phrasing is something like: make you one with everything; make me one with everything; make him one with everything; etc. 

Besides, the joke is fairly specific to simplistic western ideas of the practice of Zen as it has more recently been divorced from the Buddhist religion. 

The Dalai Lama is part of Tibetan Buddhism, which is a religion developed out of the Chinese Zen Buddhist religion. The focus of Buddhism as a religion is ultimately the achievement of nirvana, which (very simplistically) is about letting go of all earthly desires and connections more than a feeling of universal interconnection that the joke implies. So, I'm not the least bit surprised that the joke was lost on him. It definitely doesn't work well as a Buddhist joke.
And sometimes it rhymes with dead. Which Glen Campbell is.
I laughed
Mind over matter. What is mind? No matter. What is matter? Never mind.
Saw an interview on TV with the Dalai Lama and they asked him if he knew about pizza and if he wanted one with everything.  He didnt get the joke.

Which is why we should name ships are their Captains.

They get a number, of course, for when youre trying to be technical.

But for prestige, and to show ownership, they should be named for their captain, and not some random State, City, former sailor, politician or fish.

Its all so random and makes no sense.

Im either suspecting bot-directed down-votes, or people are misinterpreting the WTF part of your comment as you disagreeing with me/ siding with OP.
Sorry, I heard that story from a friend of a friend ages back mate, and I dont know anyone whos worked in America anymore, Im from Australia where this is legal, if still a grey area enforcement wise.  Ive heard that girls advertise on backpage, and if you do a good job googling Im sure youll find a couple. Generally you can find girls by a friend of a friend, if you ask around. The law makes it pretty hard and dangerous for both parties though.
Yes, it's called dying 
My girlfriend wanted to join the mile high club but I couldn't get hard so she fucked someone else. 

I couldn't give a flying fuck.
I was wondering if you could point me to a good tarot reader here in America. You know, for research.

WTF this is a suspicious account

Edit: Why the downvotes? Do you disagree? He posted like 100 links in 1 day that are unrelated to each other.
Yes. Ive heard in America they send police officers to catch working girls out in order to bring them in, by the officer posing as a client, but not handing over the money until the girl makes a sexual move. 
A way to get around this, is to have a prelude. For example, one lady kept her advertising themed as card readings with Tarot cards. The client/officer would sit down with her and do a reading, ending with verbal hints about sexual endeavours in the future, and payment for those endeavours, but nothing physical, and as card readings typically are, plausibly vague. Guy has to pay up, then the real biz happens, and the cop/client cant take the lady to anything becuase she has a solid defence of getting paid for the card reading, not the sex. Sex just happened. Coincidental. And the police officers recording will confirm it, if he hasnt conveniently lost it.
So yes, a hooker can definitely get laid off by having sex with an undercover officer.

Edit: wow, never met a purchased account before (that I know of) this is quite the novelty. Where did you by it from? What was the original owner like?
Did they have 4yrs worth of comments and posts or wasnt there much to clear out? Your posts are quite entertaining but theres  a huge amount of them, and all under 11hours old, how did you come up with the material? :) thankyou if you answer any of these

Did you just assume my variable?
In the UK version, its the y= mx+c, tutor forgot to do a little research before making a comment. No wonder they say world is in a hurry.
False, my cantonese mother doesnt say L sounds.
And I am a cynic, I usually disregard the conventional way.
You are right, it is the standard. But standards can be changed.   I can change it to =@+Q if I wanted as long as I know what the variables mean.  For the sake of pedigree, I am an engineer with plenty of math under my belt. 
But the standard form is y=mx+b. m= slope; b=Y-intercept. That is the proper way to put the slope-intercept form of a linear equation. Im a math tutor, I was working through this with a student just today.
Veriables can be veriable. It can be any letter you want as long as you know how it works. 
ahHA
It must be in your genes.

&gt; What is a oneliner?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; A oneliner is a succinct, funny or witty remark. This should all fit into the title.
&gt; Generally, if your joke would be more funny if it was split into a title and body section, its probably not a oneliner.

This is better suited to r/showerthoughts tbh
Number of lines? What the fuck, are you guys joke dictators?
Somebody said I was the most out of it, but I havent a clue if its true or not.
But the number of lines in a joke is an objective thing.

But how do you buy nothing?
English is my first language, I just forgot to proofread.... in case you couldnt figure it out it should read When I asked my wife.... nothing would make me happier...... 
Good call lol
This oneliner really changes meaning when you lose at the pronoun game and assume "his" referes to the homeless man.
That's good but i rekon it would be better if instead of saying the family was in a state of shock you said the damage caused was shocking or something equaly bad.
Yeah, I understood the intended connection, but the family was not electrocuted so it didn't quite connect the dots.

It might work this way: My family hired an amateur electrician to rewire the house, and now they're in a state of shock.
It was meant to link electrocuted and shock cos y'know electric shock but hey guess they can't all be winners

there isn't enough of a connection between plumber and brain surgery to be funny. For example you could go for a sex pun: a plumber is good at laying pipe. OR you could go for a different body parts joke: Assuming someone is good at oral sex is as foolish as assuming a urologist is good at brain surgery. Really infinite possibilities with your setup but there needs to be more correlation for it to be a joke as opposed to a statement with a metaphor. IF you were focussed on the plumber being dumber than a brain surgeon you would still yield more humor keeping the professions similar: Assuming someone is good at oral sex is as foolish as assuming the rectal thermometer nurse can conduct open heart surgery. Any rate good luck:)
This is way too clever for me

This one is very Deep Thoughts by Jack Handy-esque
Wow, such empty.
If only all that potential were used on something that benefits humanity...
Ha ha, my friend is dumb and he didn't get it. Please explain him.
Should be in r/DadJokes
You know Mike?!
Ah, just as well. The quality of these puns was going down anyways
I'll have to finish you off later, I have to go to work soon, and I don't want to get sacked.
Hey, I'm not gonna let u bring me down. I love myself, and I'm not afraid to say it. 
Don't get cocky, kid
So who do you think is winning this pun-off? I'd say that I'm a head
I don't know, sometimes it gets to the tip of a long tower of puns and it gets really hard to think of a solid one.  At that point, I wind up in these sticky situations.
This one especially amused me.
It took me far too long to get that. 
Thank you wise master *bows*
No one can explain this, you can only experience it. 
Better yet. 
One should not explain this, but experience it.
I think you missed the joke...
I genuinely don't understand the joke :( help
Yup.  If the inspectors come around, theyll shut that place down.
Again, you and your oral (puns). Why do you do this to yourself? (Make puns that have to be given orally)
I hope I don't sound like a jerk off course I am.
Well, theres only one question left to ask. Are you, like Jerry Seinfeld, the master of your domain?
Well yea, these are very tongue in cheek, I woodn't be too hard on yourself.  Nothing worth beating yourself off for.
Only 58 puns to go... Then we're at 69. However, some of these puns aren't great written, like the wood/would one- these would be much better done orally
I was going to make another pun... butt fuck it.
Did you know that dogs make puns like this too? I guess you could say that this is doggy style!
Hey, don't be a blow hard
Normally I wouldnt (wood-nt) but Im feeling extra tough today. If you dont like that then you can eat my meat
You sure have got some balls talking to me like that
At least it's not something reposted over and over, this was my first time seeing it. Good job OP!
Yet always has 3 letters tho
I get that youre at least pretending to compliment me but you dont have to be a dick about it. 
You seem like you're up for the challenge
That was a typo, but I did like your pun. Sadly I cant cum up with something as funny
Steak?  I think you meant streak, or maybe stroke... I dunno, I've been on Reddit too long, I need to *get off*
If only it was original
Hey, that's really clever!  I tip my hat to you!
Unless your penis makes noises
Me too, I know how it feels.

"...and blind hookers - You've gotta hand it to 'em!"

...personal preference though, etc etc
I find it really pensive without an axe!
I love allah but he hates gays soooo
I'd give you a hand but that would only confuse you.
You could use your head butt fuck it. 
I tried to come up with another pun to keep the steak going but it was too hard
The idiom is "turning over in her grave". 
Nothing has 7 letters.
Now there are two of them! 
This isn't a one liner

Punctuation.
Bonds... plural... multiple bonds. I suggest buying a few copies of Skyfall. 
This is getting out of hand
This joke has 8 letters.
Are you trying to draw a comparison between anal beads and shitting? If so i've never made that connection, but now I want some anal beads
Correct!
But who's on first

I don't know. Let me snif---

OH YOU CHEEKY MOFO

I thought Trump was gonna get rid of all the middle eastern people
No, but she has letters.
a.k.a. the ombudsmantra.
It doesn't have 4 letters.
No, its just one dox. 
This reminds me of the time my friend kept repeating "How Long is a Chinaman's name" for minutes on end before I realized it was a statement and not a question.
What = 4 letters

Sometimes = 9 letters

Never = 5 letters.


I am stupid so can someone explain the joke to me. I sorta get it but sorta dont
... and location.
Well, that has 4 letters.
Thats because they go where no *man* has gone before.
I'm sure it has 8 letters.
Is it bad that I got the joke but then couldn't understand this comment?
No, it would still have 2 letters.
But then it would have 9 letters.
I'm sure the original got stolen from a 1950s joke book.
And it takes 19 days to repost it.
I think she may be.  Its a bit windy out today.
Yet, occasionally has 12 letters

At first I though you meant whaaaaaat
But doesn't it have 8 letters ^^(space and an apostrophe)?
Thats a great story i sure wish i could

Youre nit making me feel good.

That makes more sense although I already knew what getting off was
I don't get it either, All Fridays matter!
Okay, look. I got off in court- I got off, I came, I ejaculated. Then, once I had an orgasm in the courtroom, they got me in trouble and threw me in jail. 

Got off in court also means you didnt get convicted of the crime you were accused. 
What's the punchline mean tho 
I dunno, man, Im trying.

Just like back when I killed... I mean we killed Par- no, Cib, Cib killed Parker and he came back

As a longer form joke:

When god was handing out chromosomes, he asked if anybody wanted an extras

you said "I'd be down with that!"
Literally lol'd. 
TRIsomy 21....tri.....3. One extra.
Everybody has the same amount of chromosomes. Somebody else having a skill you don't have is because their chromosome related to that protein is differently written.

Repost
Just saying,  I really like this one.
This one-liner was a bit oblique and I wasn't sure I understood It. So, I looked at FriendlyHusband's comment history and it was the perfect thing to do: I got the joke. It sometimes helps to know who's posting because we are the product of our experience. BTW, don't read anything negative into these comments. I am fascinated by humor. I just thought this is such an interesting example of not understanding a joke because we don't have the same shared experience as the joke teller. 
Oh okay. Thanks!
I love youtube.

It can be spelled Koran or Qu'ran (apostrophe might be wrong)
Arabic translates very roughly to English (and the Latin alphabet in general). As a result, there ends up being all sorts of different spellings for the same thing, e.g. Daesh/Daish.

So, to answer your question: probably. 
Is that the correct spelling? Good joke but I think my mind is blown..
This is a particularly clever one.

It depends on the cinema. Where I live rows are letters (A is the top row) and seats are numbered.
Such unspeakable horror

You're right. I assumed the row was the letter and the number was the seat in that row. Like seat 3 in row D, instead of the 3rd row seat D.
Its 4D because the 4th row is behind 3rd row so the person immediately behind you is who ask you to put down your hat
Wouldn't it be 3E? Or 3B?

But thats a two liner...
You should always remember:

check subreddit name before formulating an opinion.
No you didnt.
If you ever want to dye a real problem...
I guess that goes without saying....
There was some dumb shit from 8fact that alleged people sleep with their mouth open, spider crawls in, and gets consumed by the unbeknownst sleeper.

Without thinking about the plausibility of the claim, many people freaked the fuck out. Some time later the concensus became "But I rarely see spiders" and "Spiders actually prefer to keep their distance" but also "who the hell put this study together?" and the statement is now considered a memorable tidbit of satire.

You consistently post funny shit I haven't seen before on the joke-related subreddits. Two questions for you:

* Have you actually made these jokes up, or are they just less common than the usual content? 

* Do you do comedy professionally? If not, you should give it a try.

I swear that this was a comment somewhere else on Reddit. 
The Monster considered Dr. Frankenstein his Father. So it's still reasonable to assign the Monster the last name Frankenstein. 
"At length the thought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life?"

Before I answer, I'm going to mention [this recent study](https://pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/BETA-report-going-blind-to-see-more%20clearly.pdf) where female candidates were likely to be chosen over men by about 6%. 

The reason I mention the above study is not to throw out a tit for tat study factoid, but because when you take a bunch of studies in this area and put them together (which I've done), it seems that women get hired more often when it's *not an in-person interview* (ignoring quota hires), compared to when it is. 

Taken with other studies about confidence, men are more confident than women and this confidence is most obvious in person. The confidence is primarily related to the androgenic hormone testosterone, which men have in far greater quantities. Testosterone also positively correlates with risk taking, which in the context of our discussion would help when it comes to asking for the position (or for higher pay), etc. 

I have another, more controversial point about testosterone: it also positively correlates with [creativity](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/147470491401200303). And, even more controversial yet, studies like [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289611000523) and [this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22037918) indicate that men are more likely to successfully engage in humor. These traits are also favorable when selecting job candidates. 

Specific to your posted study on orchestra auditions, all of the above points play into an important but vaguely defined I-know-it-when-I-see-it factor known as stage presence. You won't pick up on that with the applicant behind a screen, but it's almost instantly noticeable when you can see them perform.

Yes, the study you linked tries to control for it, but fails to eliminate the 8% remainder - then says there is insufficient data to be sure about the rest. They may be right in the particular study they are analyzing, but it does not mean it is not a factor. 

What do you think about [this one](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/orchestrating_impartiality_the_effect_of_blind_auditions_on_female_musicians.pdf)? But I agree that such studies are artificial at best. There's too many studies trying to measure bias going either direction.

^^The one time a repost is okay is this specific line
to be fair, that's two lines
-Marilyn Monroe
&gt; The WSJ article explains the 8% difference with educational differences, meaning that those are apparently not controlled for.

The other study I linked controlled for it and found it was not a factor. In any case, since women are currently graduating at much higher rates than men, the disparity in wages is likely to trend in favor of women. 

&gt;It also fails to account for bias studies such as this one, though those are much more controversial.

That's a good example of agenda-driven researchers structuring a study to validate their own biases. Unfortunately, it's more and more common. 

That study is completely contrary to real-world figures, which show that [female applicants are hired over male applicants at a 2:1 ratio.](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360.full.pdf) So why the discrepancy? Most likely due to the fact that the participants doing the hiring knew exactly what their role was in the study and chose to game the results. This is why double-blind studies are a thing. Obviously, this one couldn't be double-blinded, but its results do not indicate anything other than that when given the chance professors will choose to advance a cause rather than stay objective. Humans--you just can't trust 'em. 


Should have been,"couldn't find the time."
A man who runs in front of a car gets tired. 
A man who runs after a car gets exhausted.
The WSJ article explains the 8% difference with educational differences, meaning that those are apparently not controlled for.

Your second quotes also do not claim much more - yes, most of the wage gap (~60% from my article) is explained by choice. It also fails to account for bias studies such as [this one](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474.abstract), though those are much more controversial.

I suppose a joke you'd only understand if you were from Toronto
And [this article](https://archive.is/rjhW2), based on more recent statistics, says that single, childless women between the ages of 22 and 30 are *out-earning* men in the same demographic by 8%. 

[This study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w11240.pdf), from back in 2005, says, "...the most important source of the wage gap is the gender difference in market investments and job choices...". In other words, it comes down to personal choices, not discrimination. They further state, "...gender differences in occupation and type of job reflect choice, not employer prejudices."
Me too! Ive never understood how anyone could get it wrong. It is so obvious.
Oh, how funny. ha ha ha...
[This article](https://web.archive.org/web/20170218020457/http://blog.dol.gov/2012/06/07/myth-busting-the-pay-gap/) says it shrinks to something more like 40% of that, so roughly 9 cents.
I used to think golf was worse than bogeys, then I was won over.
When you allow for those things the gap is about 2 cents to the dollar.
Wage gap can't fully be explained by career choices etc. But yes the gap is much smaller than those 23ct when you control for that
This one gets my stamp of approval.
How so?
Sure. Go ahead.
Whenever i get a salesman cold calling over the phone i always tell them i'm interested in what they're selling but that i'm busy to talk at that moment. I then ask for their home phone number so i can call them at another time to discuss it. When they refuse i say "Oh, so you don't like being called by complete strangers at your home, no?" 
It's based on the idea that women get paid 77 cents to every dollar a man makes. Although that's mostly true, examination of the reasons has found that its entirely due to women's choices in careers and taking vacations/benefits/etc over higher pay. For example, women in the medical field are more likely to choose to go into nursing, compared to men, who are more likely to choose being a doctor -- and of course, doctors make more money than nurses, so there's a difference in pay. 

A [pithy little meme](https://i.imgur.com/aPj0jWj.png) was made of this situation by feminist Christina Hoff Sommers.

Not necessarily. 
Although by your definition, it's not by choice, they can still be Christians, if they willingly enter into that relationship with Jesus, once they are in the Church. 

That's not to say this happens in the majority of cases. 
I too, know many reluctant Christians, who go to Church because their parents made them, but have now begun to go to Church voluntarily now they are old enough to make their own decisions.

That being said I know that this isnt the case for everyone.  

I would dare to say those is also the case for other religions as well - it must be true that most children are first introduced to the religion their parents practice, if any. 
As they grow older, they make their own choice about whether to continue following that religion, convert to another, or declare themselves agnostic, atheist, or whatever other term they choose to signify they do not follow a religion.


[removed]
First time I literally laugh out loud while browsing this subreddit. You have my upvote now, OP! 
Actually I know lots of people who regularly come to Church every Sunday only because their family made them to, not voluntarily. I believe in this case, the term 'committed to the religion' seems to be wrong, right? 
And Trump's wall will keep out the Mongols

Exactly!
Thats the point, misrepresenting Christianity can be seen as not being Christian. Calling yourself a Christian and going to church and saying certain things doesnt make you a Christian. Properly representing Christian values and having a relationship with Jesus Christ does make you a Christian.

Your statement, from your reply:
"I personally know multiple people who go to church on a regular basis on Sundays and call themselves Christians and they are some of the most racist, misogynistic, and bigoted people I know. They also use the fact that they go to church to look down on those who dont. "

...Describes those people who sadly misrepresent and let down any faithful Christians, who are supposed to live with humility, acceptance of others, and universal love for all humankind - no matter what race, country or social background they are from, or how they worship, or by what name they call 'God'.

It is a sad reflection of humanity that in every country and religion there are those who act this way. 

I'm so glad you added:
"That being said I know that this isnt the case for everyone. "

We all share this planet to live our lives as best we can - a smile and a kind gesture don't cost anything, and yet go so far to making the world a better place. 

Humanity needs to learn from our past mistakes and just get along!

Peace and love to all.
I really dont mean to argue, but I personally know multiple people who go to church on a regular basis on Sundays and call themselves Christians and they are some of the most racist, misogynistic, and bigoted people I know. They also use the fact that they go to church to look down on those who dont. 

That being said I know that this isnt the case for everyone.   
I don't know what 'fact' you base this 'advice' upon; but surely, if someone of any religion invests the time and energy to go to their chosen religion's place of worship, they are committed to that religion, as more than just a 'believer'?

It is possible to be a Christian, and not go to Church, but I would argue those Christians who attend Church regularly are more committed, as they have demonstrated that commitment by attending?

No she divorced him then he died and actually, according to my lawyers, you owe me 12 BTC
But with the whites, you can erase their history.

He is dead.

Look dude IDGAF just remember when you see him, tell him he still owe me $5 and I won't forget it!

For clarification purposes, this applies to most but not all cases. What I mean is you can get car insurance that applies to you specifically rather than your vehicle, but for the most part, most insurance plans cover the car.
Assuming that they don't have a system that combines both, as they have buildings that are both hotels and garages, I would say they would get health insurance because car insurance applies to a vehicle you own, not you specifically, and life insurance covers you and your family if you die. Health insurance covers you when you are ill and need treatment of some kind, so it would be much more practical than either life insurance or car insurance. You asked a question, you got an answer.

I (haven't slept) for 10 days is how we usually interpret the statement.  In other words, they are in a state of not sleeping for 10 days.

Oh, I see.  You're very young.  It's cool to be dreadful 'n stuff but friends are important.
Pfft. Friends are just strangers who *borrow* stuff and never return it.

Caterpillars are cool.
Alot of oneliners which contain two connected sentences via puntuation get upvoted, so we added a rule change which allowed this. We're trying to find a medium to try and please both sides.

Essentially, as it is right now, a oneliner is a joke which is contained to the title of a post. If anyone has any suggestions like I said in this post either message the subreddit or comment here because we appreciate feedback.

If you scroll through this sub, a huge chunk of posts are all in this format: &lt;setup to joke&gt; &lt; , | ; | . | : | - &gt; &lt;punchline to joke&gt;, where "|" means "or". This format is effectively two lines and would be much more appropriate in /r/jokes. Unfortunately, these are not modded out, so they end up polluting the *actual* one-liners which I'm here for. 
That's how I scroll.
Otherwise you end up with more struggle.

&gt; The major problem [encountered in time travel] is simply one of grammar, and the main work to consult in this matter is Dr. Dan Streetmentioner's *Time Traveler's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations*. It will tell you, for instance, how to describe something that was about to happen to you in the past before you avoided it by time-jumping forward two days in order to avoid it. The event will be descibed differently according to whether you are talking about it from the standpoint of your own natural time, from a time in the further future, or a time in the further past and is futher complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations while you are actually traveling from one time to another with the intention of becoming your own mother or father.

&gt; Most readers get as far as the Future Semiconditionally Modified Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up; and in fact in later aditions of the book all pages beyond this point have been left blank to save on printing costs.

&gt; The *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* skips lightly over this tangle of academic abstraction, pausing only to note that the term "Future Perfect" has been abandoned since it was discovered not to be.

No, there are actually several types of radiations. 

[Radiation](http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Radiation.html) is simply the "emission or transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles". This includes electromagnetic radiation, but also particle radiation (e.g, alpha/beta/neutron radiation), gravitational radiation (radiation in the form of gravitational waves), or acoustic radiation (e.g, sound waves, seismic waves).

Of electromagnetic radiation, there are several types. Yes, these types are defined by the various frequency ranges of electromagnetic radiation. But they are considered **types** of radiation. Gamma rays are a type of EM radiation. Visible light is another type of EM radiation. 

Note how EM radiation is said to have *types* in the following sources (Ctrl F for "type"):

https://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry/Spectroscopy/Fundamentals_of_Spectroscopy/Electromagnetic_Radiation

http://www.learner.org/courses/physics/unit/text.html?unit=2&amp;secNum=4

https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/emspectrum1.html

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation#Types_and_sources.2C_classed_by_spectral_band

In the end, it comes down to semantics. But in almost all cases, EM radiation can be divided into types. This doesn't indicate one type is altogether different from another. All EM waves are part of the same type of radiation. Frequency ranges are simply classified as types.
But they can never decide where to go
Theres only 1 kind of radiation, which comes in different frequencies.
or simply fart
Then at least I have achieved something. Thank you.
I knew how to relieve my scratch from itchiness
That was the worst joke I have heard in my entire life.
Not like any other radiation. There are common types of electromagnetic radiation that do not cause cancer, as in radio waves and infrared radiation.

**Dyscalculia**

Dyscalculia  is difficulty in learning or comprehending arithmetic, such as difficulty in understanding numbers, learning how to manipulate numbers, and learning facts in mathematics. It is generally seen as a specific developmental disorder.

Dyscalculia can occur in people from across the whole IQ range  often higher than average  along with difficulties with time, measurement, and spatial reasoning. Estimates of the prevalence of dyscalculia range between 3 and 6% of the population.

Even though it is one line it has a different/longer cadence than most one-liners. Just my opinion, not saying OP has to crosspost or something like that

I agree, though I think it's just down to this one being badly written.
Don't raise your voice with me.
So, it's kind of like they switched places. The one in Showerthoughts is a joke and the one here is an observation.

Whoa 
Initialism is the same thing as acronym. Literally synonyms
Definition ofacronym

: a word (such asNATO, radar, orlaser) formed from the initial letter or letters of each of the successive parts or major parts of a compound term;also: an abbreviation (such asFBI) formed from initial letters


He's the STAR.... get it??? STAR...
Oh, I get the joke, but there's a fundamental difference between the joke in ShowerThoughts, and what was presented here. That's a joke (a two line joke), with a setup and a payoff. This is... an observation at best.
I don't think you get the joke. But it's not worded as well as the one in r/Showerthoughts in fairness. 
This is the funniest joke on the internet. Everyone please log off permanently because nothing will ever beat this.

Ah a steak pun. That's a rare medium well done. 
I didn't get it ._. 

That's an initialism. An acronym is an initialism that's said as a word itself, instead of the letters (like 'lol' or 'laser').

The better one is: What do your mom and a hockey goalie have in common? The both change there pads every three periods. Or you could do what's the difference and say that a hockey goalie changed every three periods, but you have to emphasize it in a way that makes it seem like the person's mom DOESN'T
It's not a one-liner just because you left out a period.

Not personal memberships, my entire team deals with the content that's uploaded to the sites. We work with those sites every day. 
wait so you get free membership for working there?
I get asked this all the time and unfortunately, the answer is no. 

Though since starting my job there (originally I was tagging videos for PH, Redtube, Youporn and Tube8, moved on to working with our paid sites), I've realized that our paid content is actually REALLY good. I'll admit, I used to also think "uhh... Who the hell pays for porn, outside of cable and VOD companies?" Sure, you can find a bunch of stuff on the free sites, but there are so many brand new, high-quality (1080p, moving into 4K gradually) videos released on our paid sites every single day, I'm absolutely astounded. From one week to the next, taking all of our paid sites together, you're looking at something like 35-40 scenes released. Every. Damn. Week.

[Nice Pasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/5g0yno/i_holehardedly_agree/)

Your reply peaked my interest and I read it with baited breath. At first, I was on tender hooks and thinking of a way to extract revenge on you. Who is this alleged suppository of information spouting off? I could care less what they have to say.


Irregardless, after some do diligence, by in large, I soon realized that you had a case and point, that I was really self-depreciating, and just using you as an escape goat.


So, without further adieu, I decided to home in on the problem and nip it in the butt thus rendering it a mute point.


Chow!

I cried
I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like its a peach of cake.

Hello, I am writing this comment as it appears my boss has decided to take up conversation right outside of my office door. While my job truly never requires this much typing, I think it's important that I still appear busy and productive. He must think I'm sending an email. I am making grumpy and confused faces as I type this so he knows that I mean business. See what I did there? I looked at my other screen so he knows that I'm capable of multi-tasking and that I can type and 'research' at the same time. Thank you for reading this. Have a wonderful day and thank you for filling my life with jokey jokes.

this sub is not shit without me... pretty sure it implies it's shit as long as you're here :)
To be fair, I submitted that the day before the polls closed, I think. I'll submit earlier next time.
I guess, except this actually happened.  It takes a little context to understand the ONELINER I delivered on the fly. What kind of latent comedic genius combined with presence of mind must one have to deliver that kind of thing in real-life, in real-time?  

I was shopping; I was in the middle of a business transaction and startled by the rules of an inanimate object!  Then, BOOM, I dropped some hair-trigger hilarity on the church lady.  

It was so quick and clever, I could have probably had sex with her in the back of Walmart.  Even though she was older, heavier and married, in retrospect I wish I had.  At the time I didn't think about having to write  this post to justify the format of the comment in a Reddit forum to someone who overthinks things he doesn't actually think about. 
Please tell me where is the other negative, apart from "ain't".
stop trying to make v happen, it's not going to happen.
Regrettably downvoted, because I don't believe this is a one-liner, or belongs in this sub.

It would probably be more appropriate in /r/jokes.

Your joke is bad, because it does not make sense. Please don't bash on others for having jokes that can have some meaning extracted from them.
You know, maybe you're right. Thanks for the feedback. I genuinely appreciate it. I hope you can genuinely appreciate 138 up votes between 2 posts in 2 days on the same sub. Humble fackin brag, dolt.

Yeah I'm aware that Rex means king, I've just never heard him referred to as "Oedipus Rex". That is the literal title of Sophocles' play though, which I thought translated to "Oedipus the King".

He was a king, and Rex is the Latin for king. Oedipus Rex=King Oedipus.
Without nipples, breasts are pointless
I'm pretty sure the guys name was just Oedipus and 'Oedipus Rex' was the name of the play

This is the greatest revenge story.
You should call your insurance.
&gt; A cigar smoker bought several hundred expensive stogies and had them insured against fire. After hed smoked them all, he filed a claim, pointing out that the cigars had been destroyed by fire. The company refused to pay, and the man sued. A judge ruled that because the insurance company had agreed to insure against fire, it was legally responsible. So the company paid the claim. And when the man accepted the money, the company had him arrested for arson.

A. I still find it funny even after, I could have assumed there was a disease for this but the mere idea was funny because they were opposites. B. Im sorry for your cousin and the loss of the girl but you have to understand that there is no way in the world for me to know your cousin. It was not directed towards her in any way or was it directed towards people with her disease. C. You are right about not being able to gauge how an audience is going to feel but this is the internet so Im going to take my chances and say something I think is funny. D. It has a bit of wordplay as they both can be considered an oxymoron. The lack of shift in context was the reason I used /r/oneliner instead of /r/jokes and the nothing that makes it funny is either because you have someone related that has this illness or because my joke writing skills aren't good. Either way your argument is invalid.
I assumed you found it funny because you didn't know, so now you don't have that excuse. If you still find the suffering of others funny, fine. You don't get to tell me what I find funny. 

I watched my cousin come within days of dying from this disease. She declined over years, was in treatment for years and it took her years to recover and she still has debilitating health issues because of it. She is an amazingly strong person and this disease stole a chunk of her youth and many opportunities from her. When she was in treatment, one the people in her group was eleven years old. They didn't make it.

When you put a joke in a public place, you have no idea who's going to read it. You can't take the temperature of the room, you can't edit a joke based on the audience. On the internet, you have to assume you are talking to everybody who speaks English. 

Your joke has no wordplay, no shift in context, nothing that makes it funny in spite of the dark content. It's just punching down at two groups of people that it's currently fashionable to ostracize. And that's if you assume you don't know about the dead and dying folks. 

Dark humor is valid, [when it's done right](http://cdn.quotesgram.com/small/45/77/1337438445-crazy-boyfriend-story.jpg). 


Are you serious? 

I meant that as an excuse, as in - you called your dog "[Syndrome](http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Syndrome)". 

So the overly sensitive people can't complain about the "Down, Syndrome" phrasing. 
It's still funny to me and everyone I've told 

Just because it offends some people doesn't mean the joke isn't funny and neither does the fact that it's a rude joke. People shouldn't be offended by jokes that aren't even directed towards them in any way and neither should you.
Well, now you know why it isn't funny. 
Doesn't do any good if you skip the meetings.
I didn't know what that was and a joke is a joke. 
Wait what??? Ooohhhhhh...

i had to quit typing otherwise it would be more than a oneliner.
And nobody likes a quitter!
You can then also claim you named him after the villain from the Incredibles. 
Goddamn- a sacrilegious term 
Ah, okay. Thank you for your explanation! :) 
I'd say the entire point is that it's got a double meaning, one of which could be the intro to an actual proposition, the other is self encapsulated. As well as the fact that prepositions are single words, so a "sexy preposition" would be more like "inout" or something like that
I realize that, I just thought that that's what the joke was. I thought the reason they used "in" and "far" was because it was a preposition, not a proposition. 
A preposition is a word type denoting relative position, for example "on", "over", "inside" and so on. A proposition is an offer
Blasphemy - the act or offense of speaking sacrilegiously about God or sacred things; profane talk
Like naming your dog stains. 
Shouldn't it be "preposition" then? 
I don't get it 
If you reverse this, it makes a nice motivational phrase!

&gt; something like Bestiality would be perfect

/r/nocontext 

But yes I really like this idea and will try an implement it soon.
Yeah something like that. Although, (I know it's an example) something less broad would make it easier to write about. However, it still needs to be broad enough as to not limit creativity. For example: Animals is too broad, Lion killed in Oakland zoo is not broad enough, but something like Bestiality would be perfect.

I'm sorry if I sound pedantic I just want to make this good.
That's an easily implemented idea, I just hope that the community participates. This is something we can definitely try out and see how it goes; if it gets positive reception, we could try it weekly. 

So just as an example, one of the mods would make an announcement with a certain topic eg ("animals") and then the community would comment their original one liners which are about that topic? And whoever has the most up voted comment 'wins' the thread? 
Actually I just remembered I had an idea for this sub a few months ago. Every week there could be a stickied post with a topic in the title, and then in the comments people come up with one liners about the topic. The one with the most upvotes could be the winner of this little "competition." 

I messaged the mods about this a while ago and they said "sure, but only if you manage it." That's fair, but I don't have the time either. So I though since the sub's under partially new management you guys could consider it.
Hi u/Wyatt1710, thanks for this feedback. The mods will make sure that any reposts and any low quality posts will be removed as soon as we see them. Using the report button will help with identifying reposts and unfunny oneliners. We will make sure that this subreddit does not lost its niche qualities if we work together. Thankyou for your feedback it is much appreciated; I really agree with what you've said and I will definently be working to maintain the quality of r/oneliners!
Hello, frequent poster here. I think it's great that you guys are trying to expand the subreddit, but some of its best qualities stem from the fact that it is a small sub. For example, reposts are not nearly as frequent here as even say a slightly larger sub such as r/darkjokes. Also, a sudden deluge of new posters may provide a decrease in quality. Many people do not really know what constitutes a one liner and new posters tend to post one liners from famous comics, that many of us have seen before.

I don't really have any feedback here, you guys are doing a great job with the sub. I just wanted to put it out there that at least I personally wouldn't be averse to this remaining a niche sub.

I don't know where the idea to pour dish detergent all over my head came from, it just Dawned on me.
They say that war doesn't determine who's right, only who's left. They also say that two wrongs don't make a right, but three lefts do. Well, that means war determines one third of who's right. Clearly showing that might makes right, just not at the right proportion. If we also consider that two rights don't make a wrong, but two Wrights make an airplane, we come to the conclusion that one left is one sixth of an airplane. This shows that might makes right and who's left makes airplanes which fly. But time also flies, so six lefts is the same as time. But we know time is money, so six lefts is money. Making thirty six lefts equal to money squared. We also know that money is the root of all evil, so six lefts is the root of all evil, which is also too right. So, the root of all evil is too right, which is determined by war.

I think the moral of the story here is that ethics is complicated and best left to the philosophers who hand difficult questions like this every day.

"New novel" shouldn't be your title. The single sentence (aka one-liner) should be your title. And that should be all you post. Instead, your title could read "I'm writing a suspense novel all about..." and that would be a oneliner.

My interpretation is that someone with Jeopardy Syndrome would always talk in questions - like the contestants on the show.
Jeopardy! actually provides the answers and the game is to know the question the answer is referencing. So, if (s)he has Jeopardy! Syndrome, it would make sense that they have answers and other people provide the questions.

Once the previous person explained it, I was also tempted to make a snarky comment about how over-the-top hilarious this joke was and no other jokes will compare. Trash bags! A riot!
sounds like he got reamed.
I'm not saying you're breaking any rules; I'm just pointing out that your joke is not technically a one-liner.
Because it's r/oneliners and by using only one bag it means there's one one liner in the garbage can. It's so incredibly funny that I'm having trouble breathing. I'll never be able to laugh at anything ever again!
He only uses one liner in his trash can.

No, I think this sub is about being funny.  Which you are trying to stop because you've herd the joke before.  Way to positively contribute.  Plus the number or retold jokes on this sub is pretty damn high.  But if you personally have not herd it yet, it's probably new...   You should probably go to r/newjokes and stfu. 
This subreddit should be more about originality rather than a ripoff from the internet

Bullshit. A few years ago I had a discussion with a veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq, (who I respect very much for that), who could not tell me the difference between World War I and World War II, and the difference between Prussia and Russia.

Aside from the things I respect this person for, I find it hard to respect his knowledge of history or geography.

"...just like people wouldn't believe that the Earth is round."
Unfunny jokes sometimes don't make sense either.
Plane and simple.
Well, not exactly. An open mind doesn't mean believe everything. It means consider claims until sufficient evidence indicates the truth or falsehood of the claim. In this case there's a clear definite abundance of evidence against the claim.

But as the other user said, it's just a joke.
It's a joke, jokes don't always make sense
how is not believing flat earth theories narrow minded? you're seriously arguing that people who don't accept nonsense are not open minded??

That sounds a lot better actually.. 
I could have...but I never. 
It's not even one sentence. You just combined two sentences with an inappropriate comma. You could've said: "the birds like my new breadcrumbs-smelling aftershave I just bought". And even then, it's not funny.

Having sex is also fucking in tents. 
I mean you're allowed a day off every four years.
Well... it's an easy way to remember when you should use past.   Yup, "he passed the tents" would be correct.
Passed is a verb, so someone has to be doing it, and there usually aren't two verbs right together in a sentence.  So if you wrote, "he ran passed the tents," that would be wrong.  

Eh, like a lot of English it's just kind of instinctive after you read a lot.
Even after googling it and reading this...

 http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2015/01/passed-past/

I'm still confused on the rules. 
Hahah...made my day :)
Past tense. Past tents. It's spelled the same way.

iSee what you did there.
That sounds like it would be great, if delivered in the two parts you just described. Delivered all by one speaker, though, it doesn't have the same effect.
I never had an intended punchline. It's a comment an old school teacher used as an intelligent way of mocking someone. For example person A explains something to person B, person B says, 'oh I see' hearing this the teacher would mutter under his breath, 'said the blind man to the deaf man, walking round the corner and bumping into a lamp post' 

I thought this is the 'oneliners' section not 'jokes' 


That's exactly what I'm saying! Your joke IS the blind leading the deaf, which is not a phrase. I don't see how it works as a joke.
So even though the blind man says, 'I see' he clearly does not and cannot. 
The deaf person is deaf - he might not even realise the blind person was talking to him, as with most people that know they are talking to a blind person they tend to at least allow the deaf person to lip read and/or use sign language as well as speech, but MORE IMPORTANTLY the blind person doesn't know he is talking to anyone either he's blind..
Not really a phrase I've ever heard of.. 
This might seem dumb, but it's the blind leading the deaf
How so?


Sorry, not mine. I don't know that one.
Can you explain "#Justlikethat A goodbye is nothing but an official cutoff" next cause i dont get that one either
Seriously
I've always heard "I see, said the blind man, pissing into the wind" 
And all you have done is explain a shitty joke, that everyone already got, but didn't find funny
How did I take credit for it? I said in my original comment: "I've *heard* a similar one a lot".

And your post isn't a joke. If you find talking about blind people walking into poles funny, then you have a very demented sense of humor. Based on your posts score and % upvoted, I would say most people agree.
So in short, you don't know when a joke is a joke but your happy to slightly alter the joke then take credit for it AND you smell people's buttholes... Wow 
And yours smells like shit
An opinion is like a butthole, everybody's got one. 
Mine is, yours isn't
Right so at least you admit it's a joke. 
Exactly the same just a dog for a person - it's the blind leading the blind is all... See!
'I see' said the blind man - he's blind he cannot see, I see is a common phrase people say in recognition or to agree with something. He's talking to a deaf person who literally can't hear him. 
The joke is a metaphor for the blind leading the blind. 
All you have done us critique my joke and then say the exact same joke in a slightly different way.. See?
I always heard it as:

 "I see" said the blind man talking to his deaf dog. 
By remembering where he put them down? Blind people aren't 100% unaware of their surroundings, they still have a general sense of the space around them. Also, it's a joke, don't try to apply logic to it. 
If he was blind how could he pick up a hammer and saw? 
That's not even a joke?

I've heard a similar one a lot, but with an actual joke in it:

"I see" said the blind man, as he picked up his hammer and saw

I understand that, but a good one liner still has a bridge. 

It's like, if a joke is funniest at two lines, you can still cut it down to a one liner and it'd be funny, but it wouldn't be as funny as if it were a two liner. 

I know this is the one liner subreddit and I'm not saying he shouldn't post it, merely that if he were telling it to his friends or something, it may work better if there was some sort of bridge, which may mean it needs a couple extra words.
Not a one liner. Could easily become one, though, if you get rid of the unnecessary details.

There's an old band from Columbia, SC called Guyana Punch Line

I just got that.
Your joke is better than the OPs.  Still cringed though!

Might work better as an exchange:

Johnny: "Dad, why does the comp-sci library have a sign 'no void functions allowed'?"

Dad: "Because void functions never return anything."
I'd probably reword to something like "borrow" instead of give, or take a different approach and make it something like "The library had a strict 'No void functions allowed' rule." Still liked it, though! 
So because a void function doesn't return anything you won't get your book back but if it's not, then it will return book. Got it.
return book;
I know what a void function is and i still don't get it.
Thanks for the link! I'll try to watch it tomorrow.

It's a one liner. 
It would work better if you had a reason for bringing in German children other than the German word for children. 

Like if you were having a conversation with someone and they were asking who the kindest people are, you could say "German kids, cause they're kinder hehe" and it would have a nice justified wrap around because the conversation gave you a reason to mention German kids.

With a random joke though, you'd need to find a reason to bring in German kids other than the German word for kids. Perhaps a longer joke would let you do this.
I feel like you need a rudimentary understanding of the German language to get this. Still made my day.

Think of it this way. There are two types of karma, positive and negative. Accumulating positive or negative karma is a conscious decision, like punching a dude or donating money. Reducing karma is an unconscious action, caused by outside circumstances. Finding money on the street, or getting punched in the face randomly. 
Yes... but isn't the sum of all karma in the world pretty much equal? Newtons thirt law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
Karma isn't about what's normal. It brings everything to a neutral equilibrium of harm done. If everyone is a douche, they'll all be punished based on douchiness.
But if everyone is a douche. Isn't it normal to be a douche and therefore not douche but normal?

I've always heard it as "six one way, half a dozen the other."
This joke had me on pins and needles.
I would phrase it.

"Half of one and six dozen of the other", is a gross error.

Uhm, hence the error.
I believe that may have been the point.
Well the phrase is 6 of one, half a dozen of the other but ok.

If so, those have all kinds of safety locks, etc, on them that shouldn't even *allow* a strong person to force open the lid before pressure has been released.   
And that's true whether they're the stovetop models or the newer electric models which are mostly hands-off and even safer, if that's possible, than the non-old stovetop models.

Dyslexics of the world untie! You have nothing to loose buy your chins! 
Still not a fuckin joke holy shit this sub is 80 percent random statements 15 percent statements that technically could be a joke and 5 percent oneliners 
Seems more like a shower thought to me.
B for effort. 
i read that correctly... ugh

*edit* Or i guess technically incorrectly 
that's been on t-shirts for decades at least...

So someone hits you with a mirror? That's strange. 
I would hate if my brother drowned in his pee.
LOL!!!
Ooh a joke that expires in 2 months quick everyone use it while you can 
ThIS IS such A FUCKING BAD JOKE holy ShItttt  NO! NO! FUCK THIS ENTIRE JOKE 
HOW THE FUCK IS THIS A JOKE 
NO THIS JS NOT A JOKE FUCK 
HOLY FUCK I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA SAY THAT FUCK THIS WEBSITE NEXT WEBSITE 
Not if you can wrap your arms around the mirror.
Your arms would hit the mirror first fuck this joke next joke 
The worst part about kissing a perfect ten is how cold the mirror is.

Be careful, don't just dive into donating stuff.
You're right , I should have put a comma instead if a period. The sub is called one liners. My fault.
2 lines.
Classic tim vine line there 
think I got downvoted because no one got it. I thought it was hilarious
What?

The best memory I have of my grandma is smoking a couple of joints with her while we were camping. She asked me to get her some special brownies on her deathbed because she couldn't smoke. I got them and brought them to her. She passed before she was able to eat one.

Ok.....  I'll go sit in the corner now.
Theres a math problem in here somewhere. What would be the break even point?
Interesting. To me this is a one liner, even though it's two sentences on one line, the difference being that a "two liner" would be the more call and response style joke ("What do you call a blah blah thing? (new line) Some witty punchline."). 

I guess I could have switched the "." for a ", but" in this one to make it a single sentence one-liner.
Julying to me? August not...
If you don't replace \r\n with &lt;br/&gt; in an HTML document you will have ... a one liner.

See [ANAL_GRAVY](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneliners/comments/3ryrl6/once_i_forgot_to_replace_rn_with_br_in_an_html/cwstf4o)'s comment.
Two lines here, as usual. It's really not that hard to tell the difference but nobody seems able to get it right.

June July, but August September.
That's right. \r\n means a CRLF, which is used in plain text documents. In HTML, you have to use tags like &lt;br /&gt;. If you forgot to do that, it'd display like this:

    I forgot to replace \r\n in a HTML document

instead of

    I forgot to replace (&lt;br /&gt;)
    in a HTML document

/r/3amjokes for anything better you have.
One liners refer to jokes that are one line rather than a set-up followed by a punch line.

That's two lines. A setup and a punchline.
I think the joke would be better if it was "your mom's legs?" 

Your girlfriend liking sex all the time isn't really a diss.

WTF are acronyms? 

*Amazing
Yes, I know what a fortnight is...thing is it's not even alluded to in the original line - just doesn't make any sense. The rewrite does - but the original just doesn't - and therefore isn't funny.
Fortnight is a word for a two week period. It's not a HAR HAR HAR joke. Just  heh heh chuckle thing. Still it's original and greatly appreciated on this sub.
If you are looking directly at them then they are in sight...so it's "in sight, out of mind"...this isn't funny. Brain gone numb.
I get your version....why is the original joke funny?
I was gonna suggest you use a ? instead of a . but then it hit me.
It's you monogram
You're not the boss of me. 
Ok so I thought about this. I think I choose downing. All I would need is CPR and maybe get over pneumonia after. 
This joke really raises the steaks.

Terrible. 
I'll make a comment later....

OP keeping it classy.
The joke is I'm banging my dead grandma
Look, Either I'm too dense and don't get the joke, or you reaally wanted to say necromancy instead of necrophilia either way it made me chuckle when I read it

I like it! But I would reword it as....

I asked my wife when we were going to have our blanket-fort night and she told me two weeks.

Edit: a word
Don't,  it took me a minute to see where he was going.  "Fortnight" is derived from old English and rarely used today.  Which is why the joke was clever. 
I feel retarded now. Thanks for the explanation!
A "fort night" is two weeks.
I... I don't...
I see what you did there.  :-) 
Wood you explain this to me? I'm stumped.  I feel you didn't stick the landing on this one.  If you're trying to get a log up on the pile, this joke won't get you there.

"Who" gets to do the action in the sentence, e.g. the subject. 

"Who is going to the party?"

"Whom" is the indirect object. 

"With whom are you going?"

You is the subject of that sentence. 
Yeah it only works with text unfortunately
As the author of this one liner I can tell you I meant for it to be taken either way.
My day job is writing one-liners for Reddit, so thanks!

He didn't put his foot down to stop complying with his boss's demands -  he continued complying with them. This sub.
It does make sense though - in one interpretation he "had to put his foot down" because he was told to by his boss, in the other he "had to put his foot down" to stop his boss keep demanding things of him.
but it only made you laugh because you didn't realise that the joke doesn't make sense! 


Not at all. It made me laugh. That you don't find humor in contradiction reflects only on your sense of humour, not on OP's joke. 
in my joke, putting my foot down achieved my side of the argument in my disagreement with the mother in law. in OP's putting his foot down capitulated to his boss's demands, which is the opposite of putting his foot down in the figurative sense. he botched the joke. 
 http://imgur.com/3Gpey
I'm sorry, I didn't realize this was /r/pointlessandpettyjokeanalyzationsbyboringsadpeople
Doesn't make sense. By doing it literally you weren't doing it figuratively. Mother in law wanted me to slow down but I insisted on driving fast. I really put my foot down.

As a rule of thumb, "who" generally goes at the start of the clause (who's going?), and "whom" goes at the end (with whom?)
[This might help](http://www.grammarly.com/blog/2014/who-vs-whom-its-not-as-complicated-as-you-might-think/)

This is literally the same joke that's already in the top 25 posts of this subreddit, twice! Don't post a one liner that's already there, I don't mind reposts, but when they're already in the top 25 of the subreddit, it's not like it's most people wouldn't have or can't see it.

Remember when literally didn't mean figurityly and ain't wasn't a word.
It's honestly incredibly fascinating to me. Language and speech evolve to fit the lazy nature of casual conversations. How often have you heard "I don't know" as "ehhuhh" or "iuhhno" 
I love that I could write that and it would be easily understood. People have been using abbreviations for words since the telegraph. I think George Washington or Ben Franklin or one of those guys was the first person to use O.M.G.
Ugh

Close enough; Judaism started when Jesus was resurrected and left the cave he was buried in. When the cave was discovered empty, the king at the time told his men to spread the word that the disciples had stolen the body in order to make it seem like Jesus had been resurrected, when he actually hadn't. This story was spread around the world and it is the reason the Jews believe that Jesus isn't the Messiah. Christians however believe that Jesus WAS resurrected and walked out of the cave himself.

&gt;where judaism ends

You wish, time travel hitler
Exactly. I'm glad others get the reference. My jewish girlfriend definitely did :)
It really isn't the equivalent at all. Jesus was Jewish but is very important in Christianity. He was nailed to a cross, bro. I'm not religious so I don't know if after his crucifixion is where Judaism ends and Christianity starts officially, but the implication is in the joke. 
I thought Instagram was a service delivery for dope
Joke makes no sense. Its the equivalent of banging a white person so hard they turn black.
Instagran?
But there used to be distinct racial tensions between the Germanic people and the Italians.  Or the Anglo Saxons and the Britons.  Wouldn't they call themselves different races?
I'll bet you've just been itching to spread that wisdom.

This is more interesting than the original joke.
It's a nationality, not a race. Caucasians can include whites from Ireland, France, the USA, etc. but Irish is a nationality that can include all races including black, Caucasian, Asian, etc.
Ugggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Why aren't they?  Define a race then.

So, drilling holes is mostly boring.
It's not racism, it's ethnic criticism. 
There is a company near where I work that is in the boring industry.  I laugh every time I drive by there and see their sign.
Ethnicism; get it right!
Ah yes. Casual racism.

You think color blind means being unable to see colors?
Yeah maybe rewrite to,

"As a color blind man, all these celebrate pride pictures just look like an ad for 50 Shades of Gray."
Funny joke, but using ellipses is stretching the definition of a one liner.
Meh, I was tired. 
I think "Its all Greek to me" would go over better
A little of both. 
I have reason to believe you're not pedantic, you just seized the brilliant opportunity to say auto correct three times in a row.
Genius
I don't wanna sound like a defeatist but... we're defeated.
Maybe I use the term "auto-erect" frequently in my textual conversations.
Why would auto correct auto correct auto correct to auto erect? It doesn't correct to rhyming words.
In any event, "with joy" makes the joke's phrasing slightly awkward.
Beside oneself can mean excitement or aggitation. It isn't limited to just being upset. 
Beside yourself means really upset, which would also make sense for the joke. Like you're disappointed you found someone who looks too much like you. 
I've definitely heard it used in general conversation (admittedly by OAP's) as well as on TV and in the media in general, at least in the UK.
if someone is beside themself with joy, it means they're really happy. If I took that part out it wouldn't make as much sense
Who's joy? A friend of yours?

In terms of the one liner, I think it would be better if joy was out of the picture. This is no time for joy.
Nice :-)

Another one, from a comedian.  He's good at one-liners, if anyone can help me ID him, I'd appreciate it.

Doing something in dead earnest means with the utmost sincerity. Earnest is also a male name and maggots eat dead things. Arguing in dead earnest is a double entendre here and means the maggots are very seriously arguing and literally inside a dead man named Earnest.

The first two are the rule-breakers. "Heist" is 20th century, American-born slang which explains its deviation. No clue on "feisty".
If you could be a better public speaker, you wouldn't have to borrow from Homer Simpson.
/r/WordAvalanches
How about when you run a feisty heist with your weird beige foreign neighbor?
"B" for effort. The rest of the rule is 'except when sounded as "a" as in "neighbor" and "sleigh"'. In not-too-recent times, "weird" was pronounced "way-rd" as a possible contraction of "weyward". See [these notes](http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/macbeth/macbethglossary/macbeth1_1/macbethglos_weird.html) on _Macbeth_ . And see [this discussion](http://forum.wordreference.com/threads/we%C3%AFrd-sisters.2761740/) which focuses on how the word became "werd" (two syllables, like _nave_) before become just "weird".

in the words that the rule is referring to, the order of the lettering is C,E,I. In the rule itself, the ordering of the letters are I,E,C. That's what I took from it anyways
Also, it is [true less than half the time](https://youtu.be/duqlZXiIZqA).
It may not be it, but i'm pretty sure that's what it is :)
Wow, not my finest hour... Thanks!
i think it's the word "weird" that has "I" after "E" thus debunking the rule?
I'm either missing the joke or not enjoying it to the level you are... Could you explain?
This post deserves more than it got

Yes.
That's two sentences, doesn't that make it a two liner?

A bit clunky, I would remove the word "even" from the second clause it's useless. "I have so little will power I give up watching long montages." or something.

This was in a routine by Jimmy Carr. He wanted to come out with the shortest joke. His previous short joke was 4 words: venison's (deer/dear) isn't it. Then his 3 word joke which is this one, verbatim: Stationary store moves. His final joke was a 2 word joke: dwarf shortage.

Yes, I am totally in agreement with that point. 
Only problem is it would make more sense to say "stationery" instead.
Tori Spelling.

I'm so sorry.
I dunno. I personally enjoyed the brevity on this one and thought it enhanced the quality of the one-liner.
The minimalist attitude to sentence structure hurt this one, I appreciate that most of us are here for a short joke, but if it takes more time to comprehend than the extra would take to read then don't cut the extra. Try "The stationary store moved today."
Maybe it should be Greedo

He was incorrect. Kool-Aid powder is the solute. The water is the solvent. The finished Kool-Aid is the solution. The red water (the final solution) is still called Kool-Aid. That is the Kool-Aid I was referring to in the original post.

It is original, but so blatantly obvious not really so. I try to come up with funny stuff for a relative in a nursing home, I joined this sub for material for him. He loves to laugh and the jokes are about his speed.

Meh. I do not care what you think. You are just some invisible loser to me.
It makes me smile to think of all the happy people who get bonus sex because of my sacrifice. 
Ah yeah I used the word wrong. I guess I meant possible. Still doesn't make it true though. 
3 times a day for a year is not feasible unless you're a porn star.
Although this translates to like 3 times a day, if that, which is perfectly feasible, you're still a douche and your wife is still someone who married a douche.
Liar.
I had sex almost a thousand times this year. I guess my wife and I are not average...

Edit-I did the math wrong. My wife and I sat and worked it out because I am being called a liar. We averaged out how much sex we have and it worked out to be roughly 500 times this year, not 1000. It is still way more than average.

This joke should be extinct.
Yes, but we've all been told not to tell you.
Thank you. I only tried to make the original joke short enough for it to be a one-liner.
I like that you make the person work for the punchline. If you think it through and get to it that way it often results in being funnier for it. Bravo.
I'm selling my vacuum cleaner.  It just gathers dust anyway. 

that's actually a great idea.
i really thought this joke was awesome until i read the last part. like whoa that's really great, what a clever way to boil down the one-liner into something so pithy, so deep. i am however also high
fair enough.
Oh. I've never heard that phrase before. 
Probably should have said an elephant wearing my underwear or something. It could be understood either way in that instance.

way better.  i miss the newsprint on my fingers and the smell of the ink.  just aint the same.

I like OPs better because the 'records broken' coming first make you think Guinness book records, whereas soon as you see vinyl albums in yours it kinda makes the joke more obvious.
How about something like "Several trucks filled with vinyl albums collided on the highway. It was a record-breaking crash." 

Technically two lines, but I think it sounds better. 
Yeah well reddit in general was much better back in '77.

FYI: the plural of vinyl is vinyl...

Except you were right.
thanks. it seems that the transatlantic gulf swallowed me on the pronunciation of pa

Do you have a source for that?

http://i.imgur.com/XvAzWKw.png


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ngwa6-x_aHM

i thought so. pas isn't a homonym of paw. even remotely.
I think you have to explain what is being pronounced wrong.

"I had to take my fake bear arm off the wall because my friend told me it was a decorative faux paw." is a play on "decorative faux pas." 

&gt;A [faux pas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faux_pas) (/fop/ plural: faux pas /fopz/) is a socially awkward or tactless act, especially one that violates accepted social norms, standard customs, or the rules of etiquette.

&gt;The expression faux pas comes from French, where it means "false step", "misstep" (in a physical as well as a figurative sense).[2] It has been used in English for over 300 years.[3] Synonyms in English include gaffe and (social) blunder.

The word faux (pronounced "foe") in this instance keeps its definition of "fake" or "false" where "pas" (French for step) changes to it's English homonym "paw" (i.e., the foot of an animal).
any idea why i was downvoted? is faux pas pronounced differently in the US or something?
I think it works better like so:

I realized, after a moment of reflection, moonlight is actually sunlight.
*"I had to take my fake bear arm off the wall because my friend told me wrong was a decorative faux paw."*

Still doesn't work.
sorry but that only works if you pronounce it wrong.

sheepdog = Border Collie.  the answer is an anagram of bordercollie =&gt; Doorbell Rice!

I tried to figure this out about 2hrs ago and gave up. Thank you for putting me out of my {cryptic crossword clue for misery}.
My guess would be that 'Gala Sheepdog' is a cryptic was of describing how he felt. That being said, I'm not sure of the *exact* answer to that clue...

**WARNING - MATHS INCOMING**

When most people think of numbers, they usually think of "real" numbers, that 'exist' on a [number-line](http://imgur.com/a/ntYke#OXQuvzh).

To make a number, say 8, reverse, you [multiply it by -1](http://imgur.com/a/ntYke#JDI8Z5o). You could liken this to 'rotating' the number 180 degrees.

So what if you wanted to rotate it only 90 degrees? It is no longer a "real" number, because it isn't on the real number-line anymore. They [multiply by the imaginary number i](http://imgur.com/a/ntYke#WjijKuc), which is the 'square root of -1'.

So to make an imaginary number "real", you rotate it 90 degrees, so it's on the "real" number-line, not the "imaginary" one.

He's saying that your tense is confusing. "I miss my ex" only has the present-tense meaning of longing. "I keep missing my ex" or "I often miss my ex" has the ambiguous meaning you're going for.
I miss my ex is like missing her presence, like you miss someone that is dead. But my aim is improving is putting a spin on ahhhh forget it.

It's called "IRONY": the opposite of what you'd expect in a given situation. READ SOME BOOKS TO UNDERSTAND ENGLISH LITERATURE, READING AND WRITING, YOU BRAINLESS FUCKING TWAT. You potato-brained, cock-sucking cunt! 

A eunuch physically cannot actually get hard, because he has no balls, but ALSO because he has no sexuality; the PUN is that his life is difficult physically as well as emotionally, because he is still straight.

His life is *DIFFICULT* (read: *Hard*; this is a PUN, you fucking potato faggot) because he is surrounded by women and wants to have sex but is physically unable to.

I'd like to "stupid" it down for you further, since you are clearly incapable of even the basics, but I realize stupid just cannot be fixed. Please just kill yourself and your family.

&gt;A __non sequitur__ (/nnskwtr/; [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) for *It does not follow*) is a conversational and [literary device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_technique), often used for comedic purposes.

gotcha. Well I don't think its a very good joke but I get it now. Keep trying!
I've learned everything I can about Lanthanum to try and figure out the joke but not getting anywhere. 

The closest I can get is that you would hear "La" 22 times and then see a bunch of smurfs but I dont see why that is funny. Maybe I need to know something about smurfs? 

Is this a smurf joke or a chemistry joke?
I am disappointed. I'll need to find you an appropriate pun-ishment.

How about: I used to tell midget jokes, but then they bit me in the ass.

I would say short and sweet, but... no.
I think this works better in singular: "I used to tell a joke about a midget, but then one day it came back to bite me in the ass."

Implying that the joke is about one specific midget.
I apologise. Normally I post if I've taken it from r/jokes,  but I figured not many people would have seen that comment as when I was on that thread it was not the top comment.

There are 10 kinks of people - those who know binary and those that don't. Your example suggest 10 in binary = 1 where 10b=2. Jussayin. 
Hex is base 16. One you pass F, you cycle back around to 10, which is 16 in decimal.

10 in base 2 is 2.

10 in base 3 is 3.

10 in base 33 is 33.

Edit: Relevant comic, http://www.rustywalrus.com/images/lg/et.png
How is 10 = 1??? Where did you learn binary, or rather where didn't you learn it? 10 in binary is equal to 2 in base-10. 
01 would be no different than writing 1 in binary, while 10 is in fact a higher number, binary is technically read right to left
I always heard this version: "There are only 10 types of people, those who understand binary, and those who don't."
I hate to destroy jokes, but wouldn't it actually be 01? Because 10 = 1
The whole point is that we're not counting in decimal. Every base is base 10.
that doesn't quite work for Hex, seeing as it actually has 15 digits, if you count them in decimal
And 10 hexadecimal digits too.
Clever!

He was a hyper intelligent dude and dropped this one liner on me one night.  For some reason it stuck until I got home to a dictionary.  I had a good laugh at myself then and again when I thanked him the next time I saw him.

1 used to be considered prime but it screwed with too many "laws" that had to have 1 as an exception, eg:

"All numbers can be found by multiplying a unique set of prime numbers together" (wording is way off, but you get the point), like 8 = 2*2*2 or 6 = 2*3 or 7=7.

1 broke this because it means that 6 can be 2*3, or 2*3*1, or 2*3*1*1*1*1*1. The sets of prime numbers aren't "unique" any more. That rule stated above, along with many others, had to have an "except for 1" tagged on to work. So now 1 is no longer prime.
I don't get it..
I believe it is THE prime number!  (But, to be honest, I was an English major, so what do I know regarding mathematics?)
If you had listed 1, 3, 5, and 7 it would have been prime.

Actually physics is the study of matter, motion, and why you stop, its friction and opposable forces that actually stops you. 

So you should say "If it wasn't for friction and opposable forces, I'd be unstoppable".

True, though I think it's implied I meant standard "unary" hand counting.  If I learned 100 unique, recognizable positions for each finger, then I could count to 9,999 with two fingers in base 100.

Woah woah. Only Alabama and Mississippi. Don't lump the rest of us in with them.

Hey thanks, I was wondering where it came from.
This is a Dave Barry quote fyi. Just felt like giving credit where credit is due.
And that's what it's all about
I laughed, but this isn't as absurd as it sounds at first.
*People say I have no empathy, but I really don't care how they feel. 
Should this read as apathy? I can't relate to the humour in this joke otherwise...

Hi Idiasg, massive fan here. I was just wondering.... wait a minute.... this isn't a real AMA is it? 
/r/firstworldanarchists ?
TIL I comment instead of posting.
This has been the most conflicted upvote ever...

&gt;AMA in one liners subreddit? NO

&gt;Oh, haha it's a joke, I get it, but that's still kind of bad.

&gt;Oh wait no this is genius. 
but I do know this celibate carpenter who holds up his nuts &amp; screws
I don't think that makes it a one-liner still. The joke has to only have one  sentence (the shorter the better) that contains everything from the buildup to the punchline.

That being said, this is a pretty good joke and would do well in /r/jokes
I suppose I could've put the entire post in the title.
Not a one-liner. A one-liner requires one line.
I already heard that one, but it was a stuttering comedian. ;)
No pain, no wane.
Thanks for the breakdown. I had to read it twice though. You may want to edit it to include "ca" so special attention is paid to the difference. 
So, you're saying this doesn't even qualify as a one-liner?

I've always heard this as

Person 1: Man, this food is so intense!
Person 2: Like camping?!
Exactly what I was about to say. An infinite number of points, in fact, just like lines.
My stupid trigonometry class made it impossible for me to enjoy this joke. At first I was like "but circles have lots of points".

I used to have a friend who liked to insult my camping gear.  He got very distant.
The state abbreviation for Maine is ME. To use another state as an example:

Is it just ca, or is there another abbreviation for California.

The joke works because the abbreviation for Maine is also the word 'me'.
I still don't get it, can you guys please explain?
Same here. Had to read it three more times before it sunk in.
It took me way too long to get that.
That guy never seemed to respect the appointments he made. Such a disappointment.
Other one-liners that are three words are less:
Gloves are handy.

[Reminds of the scene from Remember the Titans](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6LbPLzJCxw#t=4s)
The double entendre is purely coincidental; I made this one liner up.
It's a double intender!

I'm a Canadian soldier. Our field rations (Individual Meal Packs, IMPs) are bilingual. To keep it dry, the bread has a tiny little desiccant package, size of a pepper pack. The bread's external sachet used to read:

Bread - Pain

Do not eat
Desiccant Package

I still laugh at the confused American who read to line 2 and went on a tirade about why would we give pain-inducing bread and tell us not to eat it.   
I thought you meant "I hate pain, unless a french man is in pain"...
Thanks.
German bread is my bro.


T.
Pain in French means bread. And I'm a whore for bread.

The blind prostitute was forces from her corner because she couldn't see her clients coming. 
Wouldn't this technically be a two-liner?  
As in, a regular joke?

Hilarious! Good luck.
Throw an 'a' in there for a useful bit of linguistic sleight of hand.  'How many children were born on a labor day?'  Just saying 'labor day' implies the holiday but not 'a day of labor', whereas 'a labor day' could more equally mean both 'one of the Labor Day holidays that has occurred' and 'a day of labor'.
And obviously didn't read the subreddit

It's fucking obvious. But shit. I like it.
That's not much info there, unfortunately...
So basically, ~~Simpsons~~ South Park did it.
How about mentioning concentration in the joke. Like, "So with all the ADD being diagnosed in America these days they are going to start opening up camps to help them concentrate."
South Park Season 5 episode 11. Aired in 2001.

Teacher: "In my class you need to be able to concentrate. Concentration is the key to succeeding in my class."     
Cartman: "Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp."

You can tell this isn't a one liner because it has two lines.

Oh I see. Hmm... If someone asks "Feeling better?" you could say "good enough to fuck your mother." It could mean you feel better and are up for joking and a good time or that you feel so bad you would fuck someones disgusting mother just to feel better. Depending on tone.

If I think of something better I'll tell you.
I understand this is an underpopulated sub, but I didn't know where else to post to get an opinion of like minded people. Do you have any suggestions?
I actually had already called in for the past two days prior to the OP, and was looking for something wittier than the weak stuff I had come up with for my first day back. When I'm not feeling well, I can come off as more of an ass.
I dont know what you were looking for but this is a place for short one sentence jokes, or one liners. Not a very populated sub. You were calling into work? how'd that go?
Huh. I didn't mean to post in the wrong sub. Thank you for the up vote, but I don't deserve it, wrong sub all. But seriously, thank you. Which sub should I have submitted to?

Can someone explain it to me please?
You have a right to be ~~cruel~~ curt with anybody who doesn't respect the fact you're having a hard time! 
And sure, PM me after the day is over, I'd love to hear how you handled it and how it went!
Mwahahaha! I dig it. The first one is my favorite :) Gonna try to be nice, but this will certainly be my first retort if I can fit it into the conversation properly with the right person! Superb.
Thanks. I don't think I'll repost. Maybe it's the beer, but I'm going to try being nice, but not the "kill'em with niceness" way. 

Hell if nothing else, it'll keep them away, maybe, so they don't get sick too. Still might cough on a few people though... Just kidding, I'm not one of those assholes who go to work contagious.

If you care, I'll let you know how it goes. I'll try to keep the same mentality as I have now.  I can't promise I won't be cruel, but I'm going to definitely give it a try.

Too bad the ratio of general public is not closer to a 1:1 with good guy redditors like yourself, or at least more GGRs showing GG qualities in public. I'll start.
"You know that scene from the Exorcist where the possessed girl pukes all over the room?  Yea... Hope you brought an umbrella... or a wetsuit."
"Nope, not sick. I'm just hoarding phlegm."
"Don't think that just because I'm vertical, I'm well."
"Auntie, Auntie, this isn't the chess club." *cough, fall down, dry heave*

Personally, I once put a biohazard sticker on a box then walked around with the box on my head.  People got the idea.
*edit:  Hope you get to feeling better! 
One liners don't really lend themselves to scientific precision.
Well....I think you might be looking in the wrong subreddit. /r/oneliners is more like /r/zing, but in 1 line. 

That being said, I think you should use the same line on people who are asking and clearly know you're sick. I feel this way when I get sick and people are being dumbasses. My primary concern would getting shit done and then getting better, so fuck those guys who are going to hinder that or belittle you in any way. You're there to get work done first and foremost in your condition. Reply politely, be frank, be professional, and if they're going to be rude then that's on them and you can live with the satisfaction that they're complete pricks. 

I hope that helps. Feel better! I hate being sick, so internet hugs for you. :) 
But peanuts are legumes...
You. You're a good person. I'm not quite there yet (at least not with the people that will be asking this question in a friendly manner, but more with a shit eating grin). Although, now that I think about it, I'll give it a go and see how that works.

Any other ideas?
How about, "No, I'm not feeling better, but thanks."?
